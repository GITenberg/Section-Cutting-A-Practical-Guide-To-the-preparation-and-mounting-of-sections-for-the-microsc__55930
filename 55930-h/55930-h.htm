  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>If we glance at any of the numerous magazines
devoted either wholly or in part to the subject of
microscopy, we shall hardly fail to be struck with
the numerous queries relating to <span class='fss'>SECTION-CUTTING</span>,
which are to be found in its pages. A simple explanation
of this wide-spread want is afforded by the
fact that the use of the microscope has at the present
day extended to (and is still rapidly spreading
amongst) vast numbers of students, who, in many
instances, possess neither the leisure nor the means
to refer for information to large and expensive text-books.
Moreover, were they actually to consult
such works, they would practically fail to obtain the
information of which they are in need, for the
coveted instruction is to be found in those treatises
only in a scattered and fragmentary form—no work
with which we are acquainted treating of the subject
in anything like a detailed manner. To fill this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span><i>vacuum</i> in the literature of microscopy the present
manualette has been prepared. Little claim is made
to originality, yet the book is by no means a mere
compilation, but the outcome of long and extensive
personal experience in the cutting and mounting of
microscopical sections. Every process described has
been put to the test of actual trial, so that its worth
may confidently be depended upon. Many of the
little points insisted upon in the ensuing pages will
doubtless to the practised microscopist appear superfluous
or even puerile; but a vivid recollection of our
own early failures and disappointments assures us
that it is just these very <i>minutiæ</i> of detail which will
be found most serviceable in directing and sustaining
the faltering footsteps of the tyro.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO AMERICAN EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c008' />
<p class='c006'>Dr. Marsh’s book cannot fail to promote the
practical study of histology wherever the English
language is spoken, and under ordinary circumstances
the students of this country might have been left to
the use of the London edition. But a careful reading
showed that one or two points which are perfectly
clear to British readers might be a source of
doubt and difficulty to students on this side. At
the present day in this country histology is a favorite
study with very many private students who have no
access to teachers or large libraries, and for the purpose
of smoothing their path we have added such information
as was obviously desirable. In the hope
that these additions will prove of value, we submit
the book to American readers.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='p1-01'></a>1. <i>Introduction.</i>—Many of the most interesting objects
with which the microscopist has to deal, cannot be
made to reveal their beauty or minute structure until
they have been cut into slices or <i>sections</i>, of such a degree
of thinness as to render them transparent, and thus
permit of their examination by transmitted light, with
objectives of varying power. Unfortunately, however,
very few of the objects of this class are, in their natural
condition, in a suitable state to be submitted to this
method of procedure. Some are of such a soft and
yielding nature that any attempt to cut them is an
utter failure, for in place of a perfect section being obtained,
nothing remains upon the knife but a mass of
diffluent pulp; others, again, are of such density as to
resist the action of any cutting instrument.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is evident, therefore, that nothing can be done
with such refractory materials until, by subjection to
appropriate methods of preparation, they shall have
been reduced to such a consistence as to render them
suitable for cutting. How this is to be accomplished
will depend entirely upon the physical and chemical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>nature of the substance to be operated upon. As the
various objects differ so widely from each other in
these respects, so must the methods of preparation
suitable to each also vary. It is clear, therefore, that
no general directions for attaining this end can be
given which would be of any practical value. It is
possible, however, and very convenient, to arrange the
various objects into groups or classes, to the treatment
of each of which certain general rules are applicable;
but there will still remain a comparatively numerous
series of objects whose individual peculiarities of structure
will demand for them correspondingly special
methods of preparation. When such objects come to
be spoken of, the particular treatment most suitable to
each will also be noticed.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-02'></a>2. <i>On Cutting unprepared Vegetable Tissues.</i>—There
are some few substances, however, which may
with more or less success be cut into sections whilst in
their natural condition. Such objects are to be found
in the vegetable world in certain kinds of leaves and
allied structures, whilst in the animal kingdom they are
principally represented by the various internal organs
of man and the lower animals. Special directions are
given in text-books for the preparation of sections of
leaves and similar substances. For instance, it is recommended
to lay the leaf, etc., on a piece of fine
cork, and with a sharp knife to shave off thin slices,
cutting down upon the cork. Another plan is to place
the leaf, etc., between two thin layers of cork, and cut
through the mass. No method, however, is at once so
simple and successful as the process of imbedding in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>paraffine. To do this, it is necessary to make a paper
mould by twisting a strip of stout writing paper round
a ruler, and turning-in the paper over the end of the
ruler. This mould, the height of which may vary
from an inch to an inch and a half, should now be
about half filled with melted paraffine mixture (§ 11),
the leaf or other object plunged into it, and held in
position by small forceps till the paraffine has become
sufficiently solidified to yield it a support. More of
the paraffine mixture is now poured in until the specimen
is thoroughly imbedded; the whole is to be put
away in a cold place for an hour or so, when the mass
will be found sufficiently firm to be cut with ease.
Sections may be made with a razor kept constantly
wetted with water, or, if the preservation of colour be
no object, methylated spirit may be employed for the
purpose. As the subsequent treatment of such sections
in no wise differs from that required by those cut in the
microtome, we shall defer its consideration until that
method of section has been described (§ 12).</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-03'></a>3.  <i>On Cutting unprepared Animal Tissues.</i>—For
the cutting of fresh <i>animal</i> tissues several plans may
be followed. Thus, if a section of only very limited
area be required, it may be obtained by snipping a
piece off the tissue with a pair of bent scissors, which,
for this purpose, are so made that the blades are <i>curved
on the flat</i> (Carpenter). If this be carefully performed
it will be found that a large portion of the section
(particularly at the circumference) so obtained will be
sufficiently thin for examination. If a larger section
be desired, an attempt may be made to cut it with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>very sharp scalpel or razor, the blade of which whilst
in use must be kept <i>flooded</i> with water, or spirit, the
latter of which is to be preferred. Recourse may also
be had to <i>Valentin’s</i> knife. This consists of two long,
narrow blades, running parallel to each other, the distance
at which the blades are held apart, and which, of
course, determines the thickness of the section, being
regulated by means of a fine screw passing through
both blades. A milled head attached to this screw
gives a ready means of opening or closing the blades,
so as to bring them to the desired degree of approximation.
The method of using the knife is very simple.
After having “set” the blades at the desired distance
apart by means of the milled head, the tissue to be cut
is held in the left hand immersed in a basin of water.
The knife is now steadily and with a rapid motion
<i>drawn</i> through the tissue, care being taken that the
cut is made in such a manner that the blades move
from heel to point. By slightly separating the blades
and gently shaking them in the water, the section at
once becomes disengaged. After use, the blades must
be thoroughly dried, when they may be smeared with
some oil which does not readily oxidize. For this purpose,
a very suitable oil is that known as “Rangoon.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Though it has been deemed advisable briefly to describe
the preceding methods of cutting unhardened tissues,
it will be found that for the purposes of the ordinary
microscopical student sections so obtained are of very
little value. They are always of very limited dimensions,
seldom of uniform thickness, and often so extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>friable as to render it very difficult and frequently impossible
to submit them with safety to such further
treatment as is necessary to fit them for being mounted
as permanent objects. This method of section-cutting,
however, is not without its uses, for by its means the
medical practitioner is provided with a simple and
ready method of roughly investigating the structure of
morbid tissues, whilst to the general student it furnishes
an easy means of making a cursory examination
of certain substances, in order that he may determine
whether it be worth his while to subject them to some
of those various processes of hardening hereafter to be
described.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f1'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. <span class='small'><a href='#N-a'>Note A.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-04'></a>4.  <i>Preparation of Vegetable Tissues.</i>—Let us now
pass to a brief consideration of the methods usually
adopted for preparing the various objects for easy section.
In the case of <i>vegetable</i> tissues, not only do we,
as a rule, find their texture of too great density to be
readily cut in their natural condition, but they also
contain much resinous and starchy matter, of which it
is highly desirable to get rid. In order to do this we
first cut the substance (say a stem or root) into small
pieces, which are to be placed in water for three or four
days, by which time all the soluble gummy matters
will have disappeared. The pieces are now transferred
to a wide-necked bottle, containing methylated spirit,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
which, in the course of a few days, will dissolve out all
the resin, etc. Many kinds of woody tissue are by
these processes reduced to a fit condition for immediate
cutting; others, however, are so hard as to render it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>necessary to give them another soaking for some hours
in water, to bring them to a sufficient degree of softness
to cut easily. If the wood (as in some few refractory
cases will happen) be still too hard for section, a
short immersion in warm, or if necessary, in boiling
water, will not fail effectually to soften it. The treatment
of such members of the vegetable division as require
peculiar methods, will be found described in
future pages.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. <span class='small'><a href='#N-b'>Note B.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-05'></a>5.  <i>Preparation of Animal Tissues.</i>—<i>Animal</i> tissues
differ from one another so greatly, both in consistence
and in chemical composition, as well as in their
degree of natural hardness, that no general rules can
be given which would be applicable to the preparation
of the whole class. Such as are of any considerable
degree of hardness, as horn and kindred structures,
must be treated much in the same manner as the denser
varieties of wood, viz., by more or less prolonged immersion
in water—cold, hot, or boiling. Those which
are of extreme hardness, as bones and teeth, can be cut
only by following certain special methods, full details
of which will be found in the Second Part of this
work (§ 26). Many, and indeed the vast majority of
animal tissues, offer a direct contrast in point of hardness
to those we have just been considering. All the
internal organs of the body are, when freshly removed,
of much too soft a nature to permit, when in their unprepared
condition, of easy or perfect cutting. It is
upon bringing them to that critical degree of hardness,
which is often so difficult to attain, that the chief
secret of successful section-cutting depends; for unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the hardening process has been carried up to, but not
beyond, a given point, which varies with different
tissues, the operator, however dexterous, will fail to
obtain satisfactory sections. For, if the hardening has
fallen short of this critical point, he is, to some extent,
in the same position as if he were dealing with unhardened
tissues; whilst, if this point has been exceeded,
the tissue will have become so brittle as to crumble
before the knife. For the purpose of hardening animal
tissues, the student has at his command two principal
agents, namely, alcohol and chromic acid, each of
which possesses advantages of its own, but the use of
each of which is also attended by its own inconveniences.
Thus, by the use of alcohol, there is very
much less risk of overhardening the specimen than if
chromic acid had been employed. Alcohol, however,
though a capital indurating agent in some instances,
does not answer so well in many others. Chromic acid
is, therefore, to be preferred for general use. It is,
however, a very delicate agent to manage, for unless
the greatest care be taken it is exceedingly likely to
overharden tissues submitted to its action, and when
this happens the specimen becomes utterly useless for
cutting, as there is no known means of removing the
extreme brittleness which it has acquired. By taking
the precautions now to be given, this overhardening
may generally be avoided. Let us harden a portion of
some viscus, say the kidney, for instance. Suppose
we cut from the organ five or six small pieces (from half
to three-quarters of an inch square, <i>not larger</i>). These
must be placed in a mixture of equal parts of methylated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>spirit and water for three days, at the end of
which period they may be transferred to a solution of
chromic acid, made by dissolving twenty grains of the
pure acid in sixteen ounces of distilled water. The
solution should be kept in a wide-necked bottle furnished
with a glass stopper. At the expiration of seven
days, pour off the solution and replace it by fresh.
At the end of another week, carefully examine the
immersed tissues, and by means of a sharp razor see if
they have acquired the necessary degree of hardness to
allow of a section of <i>moderate</i> thinness being made. If
so, remove the pieces and put them into a stoppered
bottle containing from six to eight ounces of methylated
spirit. If, however, the hardening be found not
to be sufficiently advanced, the chromic acid solution is
to be poured off and again replaced by fresh. It will
now be necessary to examine the tissues at intervals of
about two days, until they are found to be sufficiently
hard, when they must be transferred to the spirit.
Under no circumstances, however, should they be permitted
to remain in the chromic acid longer than the
end of the third week, and though they should at this
time appear not to have undergone sufficient induration,
yet it will be advisable to transfer them to the
methylated spirit, which in a short time will <i>safely</i>
complete the process of hardening, without any risk
being run of the tissue becoming ruinously brittle. It
will be noticed, that when the specimens have been
transferred to spirit, the latter will in a day or two
become of a deep yellow color, whilst a thick flocculent
deposit falls to the bottom of the bottle. The tissues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>should then be removed, the bottle emptied and well
washed, and, being refilled with clean spirit, the preparations
are again to be replaced. This may occasionally
be repeated, until the spirit becomes and remains perfectly
bright and clear. The specimens are then ready
for section.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-06'></a>6.  <i>Special Methods of Hardening.</i>—The brain
(§ 27), spinal cord (§ 43), liver (§ 34), and several
other organs, etc., require special methods of hardening,
details of which will be found in the paragraph
devoted to each. In the case of <i>injected</i> preparations,
the best plan is to harden them in alcohol from the
outset, beginning with weak spirit, and gradually increasing
the strength as the hardening proceeds.
When the object has been injected with Prussian blue,
a few drops of hydrochloric acid should be added to
the alcohol to fix the color.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may here be observed, that specimens of <i>morbid
tissues</i> require, as a general rule, a shorter immersion
in chromic acid solution than healthy tissues do. A
very small degree of overhardening speedily renders
them brittle and useless. They should, therefore, be
removed from the acid medium at the end of ten days
or a fortnight, and their further hardening carried on
by means of alcohol.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-07'></a>7.  <i>Cutting Hardened Tissues by Hand.</i>—Our material
being now reduced to a fit condition for cutting,
let us proceed to consider the several methods by which
this may be effected. The readiest and most simple
plan, if the piece be large enough, is to hold it in the
left hand, and, having brought the surface to a perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>level by cutting off several rather thick slices, endeavor
to cut a thin section by the aid of a very sharp razor,
the blade of which must be kept well <i>flooded</i> with
spirit. As in the use of <i>Valentin’s</i> knife, so here,
great care must be taken steadily to <i>draw</i> the blade
across the tissue, every effort being made to avoid
<i>pushing</i> the knife, else the section will be <i>torn off</i>, instead
of being <i>cut</i>. Though this method<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> is of very
great importance for many purposes, yet a considerable
degree of manipulative skill is required to enable
the operator to obtain anything like perfect sections by
its means, and, unfortunately, this skill is acquired by
very few persons indeed, even after much practice.
If the piece which it is desired to cut be too small to
be conveniently held in the hand, it may be imbedded
in paraffine in the manner already described (§ 3). A
very simple imbedding agent, and one of the greatest
practical value, is a strong solution of gum arabic,
which, upon being dehydrated either by ordinary drying
or the action of alcohol, soon acquires such a degree
of hardness as to permit it (with the imbedded tissue)
to be cut with ease. As this method of imbedding,
however, is most frequently resorted to where, by its
means, special difficulties have to be overcome, a full
description of the process (§ 35) will be deferred until
such special cases come to be spoken of.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f3'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. <span class='small'><a href='#N-c'>Note C.</a></span></p>
</div>
<p class='c012'><a id='p1-08'></a>8.  <i>Microtome.</i>—Although the preceding plans may
be sufficient to answer all his requirements, if the student
wishes to obtain only one or two sections of small
dimensions, of a given object, if he requires a number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of such sections he will find these methods fail him, for
even though by practice he may have attained to considerable
aptitude in the use of the knife, it will still unquestionably
happen that the vast majority of his sections
will be more or less imperfect. If, therefore, it
be desired to procure a number of perfect sections, of
equable thickness and large area, it is absolutely necessary
to resort to the use of some form or other of microtome,
or section-cutter. This instrument, in its simplest
form, merely consists of a stout brass tube closed
at one end, and being by the other fixed at right angles
into a smooth plate of metal. A plug or disk of brass,
accurately fitting the interior of the tube, is acted upon
by a fine threaded screw piercing the base of the tube,
and by means of which the plug, and any object it may
support, can be elevated at pleasure. The object by
this means being made gradually to rise out of the tube,
sections are cut from it by simply gliding a sharp knife
along the smooth cutting-plate, and hence across the
specimen. Any intelligent worker in brass would make
an instrument of this kind at a very small cost, and
although perhaps it might lack the finish of an instrument
bought at the optician’s, it would, if accurately
made, do its work as well as the most complicated and
expensive. If, however, the student resolves to purchase
a microtome, there are a variety of forms in the
market from which he may choose. A few hints may
perhaps be of service in enabling him to make a judicious
selection. At the outset we may say that unless
the student intends to devote himself solely to the production
of sections of wood, etc., he ought not to procure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>one of those forms of microtome known as wood
section-cutters, in which the object to be cut is held in
position in the tube by means of a binding screw which
pierces its side.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Although these machines are all that
can be desired for cutting hard bodies, they are not so
suitable for soft ones. The chief points to be attended
to in selecting a microtome are, (1) that the cutting-plate
of the instrument be made of glass, or in default
of this, of very hard metal of the most perfect smoothness;<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
(2) that the diameter of the tube be neither too
large nor too small—it ought not to be less than 5/8-in.,
or greater than 1 inch;<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> (3) that the screw, which should
be <i>fine</i> and well cut, be provided with a graduated
head; (4) that there be some kind of index by which
fractional portions of a revolution of the screw may be
measured; and (5) that the plug fit the tube of the
microtome so accurately that when melted paraffine,
gum, or other imbedding agent be poured into it, it
may not find its way between the plug and side of the
tube (§ 18). It often happens in cutting tissues imbedded
in paraffine, that the pressure of the knife
causes the cylinder of the imbedding agent to twist
round in the tube of the machine, and so cause considerable
difficulty and annoyance. This evil is usually
met by running a deep groove across the upper surface
of the plug, and into this the paraffine sinks, and so is
prevented from rotating. It will be found, moreover,
that another difficulty of a kindred, though much more
serious character, will frequently be encountered. During
section the paraffine has a tendency not only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>rotate, but also to become loosened from the subjacent
plug, and to <i>rise</i> in the tube of the microtome. When
this happens the power to cut sections of uniform
thickness has completely gone, for some will now be
found to be many times thicker than others; in fact,
the irregularity in this respect soon becomes so monstrous
as to render it useless to prolong the sitting. In
the ordinary run of microtomes no provision seems to
have been made to meet this difficulty, and for this
reason many instruments, of otherwise great merit,
have their efficiency seriously impaired. Fortunately,
this imperfection is easily remedied, all that is required
being that the upper surface of the plug should be furnished
with some kind of projection, having at its summit
a table-like expansion, as shown at A in the figure.
The imbedding paraffine, by penetrating beneath and
around this, becomes firmly attached to the plug, and
thus all risk of its rising is effectually avoided. If the
student wishes to secure a really first-class instrument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>none can be so confidently recommended as the freezing
microtome of Professor Rutherford. In addition
to its being the best instrument for carrying out the
freezing method (§ 18), this machine is equally effective
for cutting tissues imbedded in paraffine, or any of the
other agents used for that purpose; indeed, whatever
work a microtome <i>can</i> do, <i>this one</i> will perform.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-09'></a>9. <i>Æther Microtome.</i>—A word here as to freezing
microtomes, where the agent used is æther. Such as
have fallen under our notice have not answered the
expectations we were justly entitled to form of them.
That it is possible to freeze a piece of tissue by their
use is undeniable, but it is, as a rule, at an expenditure
of such a quantity of æther (only the very best of which
must be used) as to constitute it a very expensive proceeding.
Another serious disadvantage they possess is,
that if the supply of æther be intermitted for only a
very short time, the already frozen tissue thaws with
great and most inconvenient rapidity.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-10'></a>10. <i>Section-Knife.</i>—Of not less importance than
the microtome is the section-knife, to be used in conjunction
with it. How perfect soever the former, and
whatever the dexterity of the operator, unless he be
provided with a suitable and well-made knife, he will
never succeed in obtaining satisfactory results. As to
the most desirable <i>size</i> of the knife, much difference
of opinion seems to exist, section knives varying in this
respect from a blade of extreme shortness to one which
fell under our observation, in which the portentous
length of <i>thirteen</i> inches was attained. What advantages
were to be expected by prolonging the blade to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>this extravagant length, must remain an inscrutable
mystery to all save its designer. Concerning the <i>shape</i>
of the knife, it is frequently advised that the surface
which has to glide along the cutting-plate of the microtome
should be ground <i>flat</i>. A most unsuitable
arrangement, as a very little actual experience of
section-cutting will speedily demonstrate. After many
unsuccessful attempts to obtain a really good and reliable
section-knife, we determined to have one specially
made, which, as it has proved everything that could be
desired, merits a brief description. It is of the utmost
importance that the blade be made of good and well-tempered
steel, not only that it may be capable of receiving
an edge of the most exquisite keenness, but
also that it may <i>retain it</i>. The knife of which we
speak (and which was made by Mr. Gardner, of South
Bridge, Edinburgh) is furnished with a blade <i>four
inches</i> long, and 7/8-inch broad, set into a square handle
of boxwood, also four inches in length. The thickness
of the blade at the back is not quite 1/4-inch, while <i>both</i>
of its surfaces are slightly hollow ground. It is essentially
necessary that the back and edge of the blade be
strictly parallel to each other, otherwise the knife, when
in use, will have such a tendency to tilt over as to
render its management extremely difficult. It is very
easy to discover if this condition be fulfilled, for if on
carefully laying the flat of the blade upon a piece of
level glass, every portion of both back and edge are
found to be in close contact with it, the knife may in
this respect be considered perfect. Every student who
aspires to be a successful section-cutter should provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>himself with a good Turkey oilstone, <i>and learn to use it</i>.
He should also possess a razor strop, as it will be in
constant requisition.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> It may here be remarked that
though <i>razors</i>, as a rule, are unsuitable for use with
the microtome from want of uniformity in the thickness
of their blades, yet, if only a small object is to be
cut—for instance, a thin root or stem—very good results
may be obtained from their use, especially if one
of the old-fashioned make, having a thick back and
slightly <i>concave</i> surfaces, be employed.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-11'></a>11. <i>Imbedding in Paraffine for Microtome.</i>—Having
described at some length the various instruments
necessary for section-cutting, we will now consider how
they are to be used. Let us endeavor to cut some
sections—say of a piece of kidney—and in so doing we
will adopt the “paraffine” method of imbedding.
Ordinary paraffine, however, when used alone, is
rather too hard for our purpose. In order, therefore,
to bring it to a suitable consistence, it must be mixed
with one-fifth its weight of common unsalted lard, a
gentle heat applied, and the two thoroughly stirred
together. A quantity of this should be prepared, so
that it may always be ready when wanted—it is very
conveniently kept in an ointment pot or preserve jar,
the top of the latter being well covered, to keep out
the dust. When it is intended to use this mixture for
the purpose of imbedding, only just about the quantity
required should be melted; for in doing this it is advisable
to use as low a degree of heat as possible, not
only to prevent injury to the tissue to be imbedded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but also that the paraffine when cooling may not undergo
such an amount of contraction as to cause it to
shrink from the sides of the microtome-tube. It is
therefore a good plan to effect the melting in a water-bath,
a simple kind of which, something after the
fashion of a glue-pot, would be made for a few pence
by any tinman.</p>

<p class='c012'>The kidney which we are about to cut has, of
course, gone through the process of hardening already
described (§ 5), and is now preserved in spirit. A small
piece, say half an inch square, is selected, removed
with forceps, and placed on a bit of blotting paper,
when the surface of the tissue will rapidly become dry
(<i>only the surface</i> must be allowed to dry). It is the
usual plan now to proceed at once to imbed it in the
melted paraffine. This is a most undesirable step, and
gives rise at a later stage of our proceedings to a great
amount of trouble and annoyance, for after sections
have been cut from a tissue so imbedded it will be
found that portions of paraffine adhere to their edges
with such tenacity that in the case of many of them
there is no effectual method of removing the paraffine,
short of soaking the sections in warm æther; a very
objectionable proceeding, for though the æther will
undoubtedly remove the paraffine, it will also dissolve
out any fatty matters which the section itself may naturally
contain. All this annoyance may be prevented
by subjecting the tissue to a simple preparatory treatment
before it is imbedded in the paraffine. For this
purpose prepare a very <i>weak</i> solution of gum arabic in
water—twenty grains to the ounce. Into this, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>means of the forceps, dip for a few moments the already
<i>surface-dried</i> tissue, taking special care not to squeeze
it, or the pressure will cause the spirit from its interior
to remoisten the surface, which would prevent the
gum from adhering. We shall see the value of this a
little later on. Remove the tissue from the solution
on to blotting paper, when the superfluous gum will
speedily drain off, and in two or three minutes the
<i>surface</i> will have become quite glazy and dry. Having
melted some paraffine mixture in the water-bath, the
tissue held in the forceps must be plunged for an instant
into the heated liquid and immediately withdrawn,
when the crust of paraffine with which it is
enveloped will promptly harden. Whilst this is taking
place we may make ready the microtome. Having by
means of the milled head or handle depressed the plug
in the tube so as to leave a free opening about an inch
deep at its upper end, we must pour in the melted
paraffine, which by this time will have become a little
cooler, until the cavity be about half filled. The prepared
tissue must now be introduced, care being taken
to place it in such a position that the sections may be
cut in the desired direction. The tissue must, if necessary,
be held in position with forceps or a needle
point, till the imbedding material becomes hard enough
to give it due support. It is here to be remembered
that it will not be advisable to place the tissue in the
centre of the tube—it will be much more easily cut if
placed rather nearer to that edge of the tube which is
situated next the operator in the act of cutting. More
paraffine is to be slowly added, until the tissue is completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>covered; even after this still more should be
added, for it will be found that in cooling the paraffine
shrinks so as to leave a cup-shaped depression in its
centre, whereby portions of the tissue which were previously
covered are again laid bare. The best method
of preventing this is to use the paraffine at as low a
temperature as possible, and to use plenty of it. The
microtome, with its contents, must now be removed to
a cool place, when the paraffine will soon become solidified.
Whilst this is being accomplished we may
make our further preparations. The first thing we require
will be a large basin, full of freshly-filtered water,
and provided with a cover. A small beaker of methylated
spirit, with a dipping rod or pipette, will also be
necessary. We must now see that the section-knife is
in thorough order, to ensure which it will be advisable
to give it a few turns on the strop. An ordinary razor
will also be of service.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-12'></a>12.  <i>Employment of Microtome.</i>—The paraffine being
sufficiently hard, we will clamp the microtome on to
the table, and seat ourselves on a chair of convenient
height before it. To our right stand the basin of
water, razor, and section-knife; the beaker of spirit to
the left, and a cloth on our knee. A few turns of the
microtome screw having brought the paraffine to the
surface, a thick slice is to be cut off, and this repeated
until the imbedded tissue comes into view. This
preliminary work had best be done with the razor, as
it is needless to subject our section-knife to unnecessary
wear and tear. By a fractional revolution of the screw
the tissue is now slightly elevated, and with the pipette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>held in the left hand, a large drop of spirit is to be let
fall upon its surface. The section-knife, grasped firmly
but lightly in the right hand, is to be laid flat upon the
cutting-plate of the machine, so as to occupy the
diagonal position shown in the figure. Two fingers of
the left hand are now laid gently upon the back of the
blade, so as to give it an equable support, whilst the
knife with a rapid motion is pushed in the combined
direction of <i>forwards</i> and to the <i>left</i>, so that the blade
in cutting the tissue will pass through it from point to
heel. Thus it will be observed that the stroke of the
knife is <i>from</i> the operator—a far easier and more effective
mode of cutting than the reverse plan. The
blade of the knife, having the section just cut, either
floating in a small pool of spirit on its surface or adhering
thereto, must now be immersed in the basin of
water, when by a little very gentle agitation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>knife the section will be floated off. And now we
shall find the great practical value of immersing the
tissue in gum before imbedding, for no sooner is the
section disengaged from the knife than the thin film
of gum which separates the paraffine from it becomes
dissolved, and the section will be observed gradually to
subside to the bottom, leaving the paraffine floating
upon the surface. After carefully wiping the knife
from all shreds of paraffine, the microtome screw must
again be partially revolved, more spirit applied to the
tissue, and another section being cut, it must be transferred
to the water as before, and so on, until a sufficient
number of sections have been obtained. As to
how thin the sections should be cut, no general directions
can be given; each case must be regulated by its
own conditions. The denser the tissue, the thinner
should the section be; whilst certain substances of loose
and spongy texture do not require the sections to be
particularly thin—it may be said, however, in a general
way that sections, and especially animal ones, <i>cannot
be cut too thin</i> so long as they remain perfect and entire.
If Professor Rutherford’s microtome (as made by Gardner)
be employed, the head of the screw will be found
to be graduated into divisions of slightly unequal
value; the sections will therefore be marked by corresponding
variations of thickness, so that amongst a
number cut, there must be many of the exact thickness
to meet the requirements of any individual case.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-13'></a>13. <i>Staining Agents.</i>—Before proceeding to mount
the sections which have just been cut, it will be very
advisable that they should be submitted to the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of some staining fluid, in order to render more clear
and distinct their minute structure. Organic substances
possess the property of being able to absorb
various colouring matters from their solution, and to
incorporate such colour into their own texture. This
power of attraction is not, however, possessed by all
substances indiscriminately, or to an equal extent.
Some possess it in a high degree, while others appear
to be nearly, if not entirely, devoid of such power.
Hence it follows, that if we immerse an organic tissue
(one of our sections, for instance) of complex structure,
in a suitable staining fluid, the tissue will not become
stained in an even and uniform manner throughout,
but the several portions of it will receive varying depths
of colour in accordance with the varying attractive
power of its several constituents. By this means we
are enabled in stained sections to discriminate by their
difference of shade, minute and delicate structures,
which in the unstained condition it would be difficult
and often impossible to differentiate. For the purpose
of section-staining there are many agents in use, the
most generally suitable being carmine, logwood (§ 19),
and aniline blue (§ 27); whilst for special purposes
chloride of gold (§ 28), pyrogallate of iron (§ 28), and
several others are all of much value.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-14'></a>14. <i>Carmine Staining.</i>—In the case of animal sections,
carmine is, as a rule, to be selected, giving as it
does most satisfactory and beautiful results. Tissues
may be stained with carmine by two different plans: in
the first, a strong solution is used, and the tissue subjected
to its action for a very short period only, whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>in the latter only very weak solutions are employed, the
time of immersion being considerably prolonged. The
rapid method, however, is not to be recommended, for
the strong carmine acts so powerfully upon the tissue
as to give the various elements comprising it no time,
as it were, to exercise their power of quantitive selection,
but involves the whole in one uniform degree of
shadeless colour. By adopting the gradual method
much better results are obtained, each portion of the
tissue being now at liberty to acquire its own particular
shade. Amongst the various formulæ for the preparation
of carmine fluid, none can be so safely followed
as that devised by Dr. Lionel Beale. It runs thus:—Place
ten grains of the finest carmine in a test tube,
add thirty minims of strong liquor ammonia, boil, add
two ounces of distilled water, and filter; then add two
ounces of glycerine, and half an ounce of rectified
spirit—this solution ought to be kept in a well stoppered
bottle. The best vessels in which to stain sections
are small jars of white porcelain, capable of holding
about two fluid ounces, and furnished with lids—they
are much preferable to beakers or watch glasses,
for owing to the white background which they afford
it is very easy to watch how the staining is proceeding.
The carmine solution which we have just described is
both too strong and of too great density to be used in its
pure state. It will, therefore, require to be diluted
with distilled water before use—the most useful degree
of dilution being attained by adding one part of stain
to seven of water. Sections may be placed in this solution
for twenty-four hours, in which time they will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>usually be found to have acquired a sufficient depth of
colour. If, however, the tissue be unusually difficult
to stain, the time of immersion may be doubled, or still
further prolonged, without detriment to the section.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>SECTION SPOON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Having prepared and filtered some of this dilute
solution, say an ounce, let us proceed to stain with it
those sections which we left in the basin of water (§ 12).
Here we are at once met by a practical difficulty. How
are the sections to be transferred from one vessel to the
other? This is ordinarily effected by means of a soft
camel’s-hair pencil. It is a method, however, open to
grave objections, for the sections so curl around the
brush, and get entangled amidst its hairs, that, notwithstanding
every care, valuable sections not unfrequently
become torn during transit. Every difficulty
at once vanishes if we substitute for the brush a small
implement, which any one can readily make for himself.
All that is necessary is to take a strip of German-silver,
or copper, of the thickness of stout cardboard,
and about seven inches in length by five-eighths of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>inch in breadth. The sharp angles are to be filed off
and the edges carefully smoothed, whilst at a distance of
five-eighths of an inch from each extremity the end must
be turned up so as to form an angle of about 35°. One
end must be left plain, whilst the other, with the aid
of a punch or drill, is to be pierced with five holes
about the thickness of a stocking needle<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> (see Figure).
If we now dip the perforated end of this spoon into the
water containing the sections, and gently agitate it,
the sections will rise from the bottom and float about.
The spoon is now brought under one of them, and
being steadily lifted up the water flows downwards
through its apertures, and the section smoothly spreading
itself out upon the spoon, may be gently lifted out
of the water, and on the spoon being dipped into the
staining fluid the section at once floats off. By this
simple means sections, however large, thin or delicate,
may with ease be conveyed from one fluid to another,
with the utmost certainty of their not being injured
during the process. The sections having been in the
carmine fluid for about twenty-four hours, as much of
the liquor as is possible must be gently poured off, and
its place supplied by a freshly-filtered mixture of five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>drops of glacial-acetic acid to one ounce of water, when
in a few moments the carmine will become permanently
<i>fixed</i> in the tissue, and the process of staining be complete.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f8'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. <span class='small'>Dr. Klein describes a kind of “lifter,” made by bending
some German-silver wire, but as no drawing accompanies his
description, it is not easy to form a clear idea as to the form of
this instrument. In the recent and philosophical work of Schäfer,
a lifter is figured, which consists of a wire stem, having attached
to its end a spade-like blade. It will be observed that the spoon
described in the text differs from this lifter in having one end
perforated, and in this consists the real value of the implement.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-15'></a>15. <i>Mounting Media.</i>—The further treatment of
the stained sections will entirely depend upon the
nature of the medium in which it is intended to mount
them. There are a variety of fluids in use for this
purpose, the principal being dilute alcohol (§ 26),
dammar, or Canada balsam (§ 22-23), and glycerine.
These, however, cannot be used indiscriminately, each
possessing certain special properties which render it
suitable for use with particular classes of objects only.
Thus, weak spirit, having no tendency to increase the
transparency of objects, can advantageously be used
with such only as are already perfectly transparent.
It is also more suitable for the preservation of vegetable
tissues (when the retention of colour is no object)
than animal, since with the latter it has a tendency
after a while to cause a kind of granular disintegration,
which ultimately destroys much of the usefulness of
the preparation. Dammar and Canada balsam, on the
other hand, possess very great refractive power, so that
they are of great service in mounting objects which
require their transparency to be much increased. For
this reason they are not well adapted to the preservation
of very delicate or transparent tissues (unless previously
stained), the minute details of which become
almost entirely obliterated when mounted in them.
The chief advantage possessed by these resinous media
is, that tissues mounted in them undergo no alteration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>even after the lapse of many years. Glycerine, in respect
of its clarifying powers, occupies an intermediate
position between spirit and balsam, being much more
refractive than the former, infinitely less so than the
latter. It is, therefore, of very great value for the
preservation of such tissues as possess a medium degree
of transparency, and which would become obscured if
mounted in spirit, or have their outlines rendered indistinct
if preserved in balsam. It is of the utmost
value for mounting unstained anatomical sections
which, when put up in this medium, reveal such
minute details of structure as would readily have escaped
observation had any other agent been employed.
It may also be used with stained sections, but in this
case the sections should be of extreme thinness, otherwise
the refractive power of the glycerine will be insufficient
to render them thoroughly transparent. The
great drawback to the use of glycerine is the extreme
difficulty experienced in preventing its escape from
beneath the covering glass, for it unfortunately possesses
such great penetrating power that no cement
hitherto devised can be thoroughly depended upon for
withstanding its solvent action for any considerable
length of time.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Attention to the instructions presently
to be given (§ 16) will, however, reduce this risk
of leakage to a minimum. In the use of glycerine Dr.
Carpenter’s caution must ever be borne in mind, viz.,
that, as carbonate of lime is in time dissolved by
glycerine, this agent ought never to be employed for
the preservation of objects containing such salt.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f9'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. <span class='small'><a href='#N-h'>Note H.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><a id='p1-16'></a>16. <i>Mounting in Glycerine.</i>—To illustrate the
method of using this medium we will mount our present
sections in glycerine. In the first place we shall
require a deep watch-glass, which is to be half filled
with glycerine diluted with an equal amount of distilled
water. By means of the spoon, one or more sections
may be transferred into this, either directly from the
acetic acid solution (§ 14), or if, since cutting, they
have been preserved in spirit, they should first undergo
a short immersion in a large vessel full of water. The
watch-glass should now be covered with an inverted
wine-glass, and put away for some hours, in order that
the sections may become thoroughly saturated with the
dilute glycerine. When this has been accomplished, a
slide must be cleaned, and one of the sections, with
the aid of the <i>unpierced</i> end of the spoon, be transferred
to its centre.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> As the kind of section with
which we are now dealing is, or ought to be, of extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>thinness, no cell (§ 26) is necessary. After tilting
up one end of the slide, so as to drain off as much
of the weak glycerine as possible, a drop of Price’s best
glycerine must, with a glass rod or pipette, be allowed
to fall gently upon the section, so as to avoid the formation
of air-bubbles. If any of these, however,
should be produced, they must be removed with the
point of a needle set in a wooden handle,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and the
slide then covered with a small bell-glass (or wine-glass).
A circular cover is now to be cleaned with a
soft handkerchief, and after gently blowing from it
any adhering fibres of lint, etc., it will be advisable to
hold the side of the glass which is to come into contact
with the preparation close to the mouth, and breathe
upon it, so as to cover it with moisture. The cover
held between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand
must now be applied by its edge near to the margin of
the preparation, and the surface of the cover directed
in an inclined manner over it. Beneath the overhanging
edge of the cover the point of the needle, held in
the right hand, is now to be inserted (see Figure). By
gently lowering the needle, the cover will come into
gradual contact with the slide, driving before it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>minute wave of glycerine, in which any air-bubbles
that may have become developed are usually carried off.
A very considerable degree of tact, however, is required
to perform this little operation, simple as it may appear,
for the retreating wave of glycerine not unfrequently
floats out the section, either wholly or partially,
from beneath the cover. Air-bubbles, also (the <i>bêtes
noires</i> of this process), are exceedingly likely to arise.
When this happens the best plan to adopt is, by means of
the needle point, gently to raise and remove the cover,
apply another drop of glycerine to the section, and
cover <i>with a fresh piece of thin glass</i>. It will now be
necessary to remove any superfluous glycerine which
may have collected around and near the cover. The
great bulk must be wiped away by means of a camel’s-hair
pencil, slightly wetted between the lips, any remaining
stickiness being removed with a bit of blotting
paper which has been slightly damped. With a very
small camel’s-hair pencil, charged with solution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>gelatine, a ring must be made round the margin of the
cover, of sufficient breadth to take in a small tract of
both cover and slide. As this cement is perfectly miscible
with glycerine, it readily unites with any of that
fluid which may ooze from beneath the cover, and
which, in the case of any of the ordinary varnishes,
would act as a fatal obstacle to perfect adhesion. To
make the cement, take half an ounce of Nelson’s opaque
gelatine, put in a small beaker, add sufficient cold
water to cover it, and allow the mixture to remain
until the gelatine has become thoroughly soaked. The
water is now poured off, and heat applied until the
gelatine becomes fluid, when three drops of creosote
should be well stirred in, and the fluid mixture transferred
to a small bottle to solidify. Before use, this
compound must be rendered liquid by immersing the
bottle containing it in a cup of warm water. When
the ring of gelatine has become quite set and dry (which
will not take long), every trace of glycerine must be
carefully removed from the cover and its neighborhood,
by gently swabbing these parts with a large camel’s-hair
pencil dipped in methylated spirit. After drying
the slide a ring of Bell’s microscopical cement may be
applied over the gelatine, and, when this is dry, another
coat is to be laid on. If it be desired to give the slide
a neat and tasteful appearance, it is a very easy matter,
by means of the turn-table, to lay on a final ring of
Brunswick black or white zinc cement (§ 24). Every
care has now been taken to render our preparation permanent;
but, to make assurance doubly sure, it will
be well to follow Dr. Carpenter’s advice, and, every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>year or so, to lay on a thin coating of good gold-size.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c014' id='f10'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. <span class='small'>The appearance of a slide is vastly improved if the preparation be
placed <i>exactly</i> in its centre. This may readily be done in the
following manner:—Take some very finely-powdered Prussian blue, and rub
it up in a mortar with a little of the weak gum solution (§ 11), so as
to form a thin blue pigment. A quantity of this should be made, so as
always to be at hand. A slide having been cleaned, the <i>best
surface</i> is to be selected, and on the <i>reverse</i> side, by means
of the self-centring turn-table, a small circle is to be drawn with a
camel’s-hair pencil, charged with the pigment. In the centre of this
ring, but on the opposite side of the slide, the section is to be
placed, when it of course will occupy a position exactly central. When
the slide comes to be finished, the blue ring may easily be removed
with a wet rag.</span></p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c014' id='f11'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.  <span class='small'>A <i>crochet-needle</i> holder made of bone, and which may be
bought at the smallware dealers’ for about sixpence, makes an
admirable handle for microscopical needles. At one extremity
there is a small cavity, closed with a cap, for the storage of reserve
needles, whilst the other end terminates in a metal tip,
provided with a crucial slit and central perforation for the
reception of the needle in actual use, and so arranged that, by
means of a small screw-nut, needles of various sizes may be
firmly held in position.</span></p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c014' id='f12'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. <span class='small'>If square covers be employed, they may be fixed to the
slide by a simple method much in vogue in Germany. A thin
wax taper is to be lighted, and being partially inverted for a
few seconds, the wax surrounding the wick will become melted.
After the slide has been freed from excess of glycerine, a drop
of this heated wax is allowed to fall upon each corner of the
cover, and a line of the melted wax run along the margins of
the cover between these points, so as perfectly to surround it.
If a good coat of white zinc cement be subsequently laid over
the wax a very durable, and not unornamental, line of union will
have been formed.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-17'></a>17. <i>Use of Freezing Microtome.</i>—Our preceding
consideration of the method of employing the microtome
in conjunction with paraffine as an imbedding
agent (§ 11), will have formed a very suitable introduction
to the study of the somewhat more complicated
process of imbedding the tissue in gum, for section in
the freezing microtome. This method is of the utmost
value to the practical histologist, for by its means he is
enabled with ease to possess himself of perfect sections
of several structures, the cutting of which, before the
introduction of this process, was always a matter of
difficulty and anxiety. The freezing microtome is
especially valuable for the section of such substances
as from their extreme delicacy are liable to be injured
by being imbedded in paraffine—for instance, the delicate
villi of the intestines becomes very frequently, by
the use of paraffine, denuded of their epithelium, and
the villi themselves not seldom become torn off or otherwise
damaged. The great value of the method is also
very well seen in the treatment of those tissues which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>like the lung, are of such loose and spongy texture as
to offer insufficient resistance to the knife unless their
interstices have previously been filled up with some
solid yet easily cut material. As the space at our command
is strictly limited, we are precluded from entering
as fully into this branch of section-cutting as the
importance of the subject demands and our own inclination
would lead us. To those who wish to become
thoroughly conversant with the full value of this method
we cannot do better than recommend the perusal of
Professor Rutherford’s <i>Practical Histology</i>, 2d edition,
than which, on the whole subject of physiological
microscopy, no treatise with which we are acquainted
is at once so plain, practical, and profound.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-18'></a>18. <i>Employment of Freezing Microtome.</i>—A very
suitable object with which to demonstrate the method
of using this form of microtome will be afforded us by
a portion of intestine, say of the ileum of a cat or dog.
Suppose we have some of this in methylated spirit—let
us select a piece of about half an inch in length.
Our first care will be to deprive this of its spirit; for
so long as the tissue remains impregnated with alcohol
it would, of course, be impossible to freeze it. We will,
therefore, throw it into a large basinful of water, and
leave it there for twenty-four hours, during which time
it would be as well to change the water once or twice.
We shall now require a strong solution of gum. This,
which should have been made some time previously,
may be prepared by placing a quantity, say three or
four ounces, of ordinary gum arabic in a glass beaker,
and adding sufficient water to cover it—the mixture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>must be stirred occasionally with a glass rod until solution
has taken place, which will be in a few days. If
<i>necessary</i> a little more water may be added, but so long
as the gum will pour from vessel to vessel, it cannot
well be made too strong. Mucilage, by keeping, is very
apt to become sour and mouldy—this may be prevented
by adding to each ounce of the water with which it is
prepared about half a grain of salicylic acid. We now
pour some of this mucilage into a small vessel—an egg
cup will answer very well—and into it transfer the
piece of ileum from the water. Here we must allow it
to remain for a time sufficient to permit of its becoming
thoroughly saturated with the gum, for which purpose
some hours will be necessary. When this soaking
has been accomplished we will prepare the microtome,
which we will assume to be Rutherford’s. In the first
place it will be necessary to remove the plug—which is
to be done by turning the handle connected with the
screw until the plug rises so high in its tube that it
may be grasped with the fingers and removed, when it
is to be well smeared all over with sperm oil and replaced.
This is done to prevent any unpleasant adhesions
taking place whilst the freezing is going on. We
must next depress the plug, so as to convert the upper
part of the tube into a kind of “well” of sufficient
depth to hold our specimen. It will now be very advisable
to look carefully into this <i>well</i> and observe whether
the plug fits accurately into the tube (§ 8) for if there
be any interval between the two it will give rise to
much subsequent annoyance, as the gum penetrating
this interstice will there become firmly frozen into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>irregular patches, which will so interfere with the even
gliding of the plug within its tube as to cause the
former to ascend in such an irregular and jerky manner
as to be utterly destructive of all accuracy in the cutting.
If this defect be observed, it may be at once
remedied by dropping a small quantity of gently heated
paraffine into the <i>well</i>, which will effectually close up
any fissures. The microtome, by means of its clamping
arrangement, must now be firmly attached to the
table, and a suitable vessel be placed on the floor beneath
it, so that it may catch the water which will
issue from the waste-pipe of the apparatus. The next
requirement is a supply of block ice and finely-powdered
salt. A lump of the ice must be wrapped in a towel,
and crushed into small pieces; these, by means of a
large mortar, are to be further reduced to a very <i>fine
powder</i>. Any attempt to hurry over this troublesome
part of the operation will lead to future disappointment,
for unless the ice be used in a very fine powder great
delay (at least) in the freezing will be the result. With
the aid of a small spoon the ice and salt are in alternate
spoonsful to be conveyed into the freezing-box of
the machine, great care being taken that the cavity
under the cutting-plate and around the tube be
thoroughly packed, after which the uncovered portion
of the box should also be well filled. The <i>well</i> is now
to be filled with the strong gum to within a little distance
of its top, and a piece of sheet gutta-percha (such
as shoe soles are made of) being applied over the well,
and kept in position by a weight, we must wait until
the freezing commences. In a short time we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>notice that the gum has acquired a thick muddy appearance.
The tissue must now, by means of the forceps,
be transferred to the well, and there placed in
such a position that the sections, when cut, shall run
in the desired direction. After more gum has, if necessary,
been added, so as completely to cover the tissue,
the well is again to be covered, and attention given to
the freezing-box. As the mixture which this contains
becomes melted, it must constantly be renewed, care
being at the same time taken that the mouth of the
discharge-pipe be kept quite free, otherwise water
accumulating in the box, the freezing mixture will
degenerate into a useless puddle. When the gum becomes
sufficiently hard to cut, this must be done much
in the same manner as if paraffine had been used (§ 12).
In this case, however, no fluid will be required, or
must be used, to wet the knife with, and especial care
must be taken that in disengaging the sections from
the knife into the water they be not torn. These sections
often adhere very tenaciously to the blade, but if
a little patience be exercised the water will soon float
them off in safety—much more safely than if any
attempt be made to liberate them prematurely. There
is one circumstance connected with the use of the freezing
microtome which is rather annoying. The moisture
of the breath and atmosphere is apt to become
condensed on the cutting-plate, and here, mixed with
accidental smears of gum, it becomes frozen into a jagged
and irregular sheet of ice, which not only seriously
interferes with the smooth play of the knife, but also
constitutes a real peril to its edge. As this evil cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>be avoided, all we can do is, by constant wiping, to
keep the cutting-plate clean and free from this accumulation.
This is best done with a bit of soft rag <i>just
moistened</i> with spirit, but this must not come into contact
with any portion of the cylinder of frozen gum,
else it will instantly thaw it. When using the freezing
microtome it is always advisable to wear an apron,
otherwise our clothes may receive considerable damage
from the constant splashing of the salt water, as it falls
from the waste-pipe into the vessel beneath it. After
use, the microtome must be well washed in plenty of
cold water till every trace of salt be removed, for if any
of this remain it will quickly corrode the brass-work of
the instrument. The plug and screw, as also the section-knife,
should be well smeared with Rangoon oil
before the machine is put away.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-19'></a>19. <i>Logwood Staining.</i>—The employment of logwood
as a staining agent is now becoming very general.
It acts much in the same manner as carmine, but the
violet color which it produces is by many thought to
be of a more soft and agreeable character than that
due to the action of carmine. A valuable and very
convenient property also which it possesses is that it
stains tissues very rapidly, and this without interfering
with that differential kind of coloration (§ 14) upon
which the chief value of all staining processes depends.
A simple method of preparing the logwood fluid is to
mix an aqueous solution of extract of logwood with a
solution of alum (1 to 8) till the deep impure red colour
has become violet, and then to filter the mixture (Frey).
This will stain sections in about half an hour. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>stain, though here mentioned for the ease with which
it may be made is, as a rule, very inferior to a fluid
prepared directly from hæmatoxylon, the alkaloid or
active principle of logwood. As, however, it is difficult
and troublesome to make the solution in this
manner,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> it will be advisable for the student to purchase,
ready prepared, such small quantity of the dye
as he may require. Small bottles may be obtained for
a few pence of Mr. Martindale, 10, New Cavendish
Street, London, and from repeated trials of this solution
we can recommend it as producing excellent results.
It is a very strong fluid, and requires to be
diluted before use. The degree to which the dilution
must be carried cannot, however, be very accurately
indicated, for all staining fluids of this nature possess
the very undesirable property of becoming decomposed
by age. After the fluid has been kept for some time,
a portion of the colouring matter is thrown out of solution,
and becomes deposited upon the sides and bottom
of the vessel in which it is contained, hence the older
the preparation, the weaker it will have become. As
the time required for staining with logwood is but
short, it is desirable that all the sections should begin
to be submitted to its action at the same time, otherwise
some will become more deeply stained than others.
A good plan is to fill a small porcelain jar (§ 14) with
filtered water, and into this transfer the sections.
Whilst they are settling well down to the bottom, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>mixture must be prepared of half a drachm of Martindale’s
solution (fresh) to one ounce of distilled water,
and everything got in readiness for its immediate filtration.
The water is now very gently to be poured
off the sections, and if care be exercised this may be
done in such a manner as to leave them undisturbed
at the bottom, after removing almost every drop of
water. The diluted logwood fluid must now be <i>immediately</i>
filtered upon the sections, so that they may run
no risk of becoming dry. In the present instance the
staining may be allowed to proceed for about thirty
minutes, and this will be found a convenient time for
the immersion of the general run of animal sections.
If the logwood fluid be not quite fresh, either a little
more of it will have to be added to the water, or the
time of immersion must be prolonged until the desired
depth of color has been produced. It is well whilst the
staining is going on gently to shake the vessel occasionally,
so that the sections may not remain in a heap at
the bottom, but all be as fully as possible exposed to
the action of the dye. When the staining is judged to
be complete, the logwood solution must be gently
poured off, leaving the stained sections at the bottom
of the jar, when they should be quickly covered with
methylated spirit, which will <i>fix</i> the colour. We shall
now be able to see if the coloration obtained be perfectly
satisfactory. If not deep enough, it is very easy
again to submit them to the action of the dye for a few
minutes longer. If on the other hand, and as more
frequently happens, the coloration should be too deep,
the excess of colour may readily be removed by transferring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the sections for a short time into some diluted
acetic acid prepared by adding five drops of the glacial
acid to an ounce of water. The action of this should
be carefully watched, and when the colour has been
reduced to the desired tint the sections may be retransferred
to the methylated spirit.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f13'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. <span class='small'>Should the student, however, determine to prepare this
solution for himself, he will find a good formula for the purpose
in Schäfer’s “Practical Histology,” p 176. <a href='#N-i'>Note I.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-20'></a>20. <i>Absolute Alcohol.</i>—As we purpose mounting
the sections which have just been stained, in Canada
balsam, we will briefly consider the preliminary treatment
to which they must be submitted before this can
be effected. The object of this is to abstract from the
tissue all its water, for if any moisture be permitted to
remain in the section it will, when mounted in balsam,
become obscured and surrounded by a kind of opalescent
halo, due to the imperfect penetration of the balsam
into the only partially dehydrated tissue. The
old-fashioned plan of dehydration was simple exposure
to the air. The method now generally adopted is to
bring about the same result by means of absolute
alcohol. This fluid has such a strong affinity for water
that tissues submitted to its influence are rapidly and
effectually deprived of any water they may contain.
Absolute alcohol in small quantity may be obtained
from the druggist at about sixpence per ounce. It will
be necessary for the student to provide himself with a
little of this agent, say about two ounces, the method
of using which will very shortly be explained. Absolute
alcohol must be kept in a bottle with a very accurately-fitting
stopper, in order to prevent its absorbing
moisture from the air. For our purpose such a bottle,
having a neck <i>as wide as possible</i>, is to be selected.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><a id='p1-21'></a>21. <i>Clove Oil.</i>—After being thoroughly dehydrated
the sections may, in special instances (§ 48), be at once
mounted in balsam; but, as a general rule, it will be
found necessary (particularly in the case of animal
sections) to treat them with some clarifying agent, in
order to remove the cloudiness and opacity which is
(in part) due to their previous immersion in alcohol.
For this purpose turpentine, or any of the essential
oils, may be used: of these, oil of cloves is to be specially
recommended. It is rather expensive, ranging
from sixpence to one shilling per ounce: but, as a drop
or two will be sufficient for preparing each slide, only
a small quantity—say half an ounce or an ounce—need
be procured. The most convenient vessel in which to
keep the oil is one of the small test bottles used by
watchmakers. These bottles are provided with a glass
cap to exclude dust, and the stopper is prolonged into
a glass rod, which dips into the bottle. The use of
this rod and the method of employing the oil will be
explained shortly.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-22'></a>22. <i>Canada Balsam</i>, as ordinarily met with, is a
thick resinous balm of great viscidity, but readily rendered
perfectly fluid by the application of heat.
Formerly, sections were mounted in this medium in its
pure state, but owing to the annoyance which was so
constantly being experienced from the tenacity with
which intruding air-bubbles were held by the viscous
medium, this plan of mounting is rapidly falling out of
use.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> It is now usual to employ the balsam in a diluted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>condition, the two chief diluents being chloroform
and benzole. As balsam, however, often contains
more or less moisture, it is desirable to drive this off
before adding the diluent. A very convenient way of
doing so is to expose some pure balsam to the heat of a
cool oven for several hours, when the balsam will be
found to have assumed a hard, vitreous character. It
should now be broken into small pieces, these put into
a bottle, and some methylated chloroform added, which
in a little while will completely dissolve the hardened
balsam. More chloroform is then to be added, until a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>solution is obtained sufficiently thin to run through
filtering-paper. A glass spirit lamp must now be procured,
having a capacity of about two ounces, and
provided with a cap. Into the wick-holder of this
(which must be made of porcelain) a hollow glass tube
is to be so fitted that its end dips into the lamp to
within about a third of the bottom. (See Fig.) The
thin chloroform-balsam is now to be filtered into this
lamp, very fine filtering-paper—through which a little
chloroform has first been passed—being used for the
purpose. When the lamp is full it must (deprived of
its cap) be put in a warm place until sufficient of the
chloroform has evaporated to leave behind it a fluid of
the consistence of thin syrup.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f14'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. <span class='small'>Although we cannot too strongly insist upon the use of
chloroform-balsam wherever practicable, yet it sometimes happens
in the mounting of substances of <i>considerable thickness</i>,
that after all the chloroform has evaporated an insufficient
amount of balsam is left behind to fill up the cavity between
slide and cover. In such cases, therefore, it is advisable to use
pure balsam, which may be done in the following manner. The
object having been previously thoroughly dehydrated by immersion
in absolute alcohol, is to be thence transferred to a little
good turpentine, or benzole, where it should remain until perfectly
transparent. It is now to be placed in the centre of a
slide which has been gently warmed, and a drop or two of <i>fresh</i>
fluid balsam added, the greatest care being taken to prevent the
formation of air-bubbles. Should such arise they must be
touched with the point of a heated needle, which will cause
them to burst and disappear. The chief difficulty of the process
has yet to be encountered in the application of the cover;
for it is during this procedure that the development of air-bubbles
is most likely to take place. This annoyance may,
however, be entirely avoided by taking the simple precaution
of dipping the cover into turpentine before it is applied (§ 16),
when it will be found that “you can’t get air-bubbles, even if
you try.” The courtesy of Mr. J. A. Kay, of Chatham, enables
us to give our readers the benefit of this practical “<i>wrinkle</i>.”</span></p>

<p>SPIRIT LAMP ADAPTED TO CONTAIN BALSAM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-23'></a>23. <i>Mounting in Balsam.</i>—Let us now return to our
sections which, it will be remembered, were left in
methylated spirit (§ 19). These we will now mount in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>balsam, and although, of course, any number may be
proceeded with at the same time, yet to avoid confusion,
in the following directions one section only will
be spoken of. This section then is, with the perforated
spoon, to be transferred to the bottle of absolute alcohol,
where it may remain for about an hour—considerably
less time is <i>actually</i> required, but as from constant use
the spirit becomes weakened, it is as well to be on the
safe side. It must now be removed to the centre of a
clean glass slip, and here the <i>plain</i> end of the spoon
comes into use. If this be employed for effecting the
transfer, it will be found that when the section is being
removed from the alcohol it will bring along with it a
small pool of the spirit. A slight touch of the needle applied
to the edge of the section will cause it to float from
the spoon on to the slide, at the same time carrying
the pool of alcohol with it, in which it will gently spread
itself out upon the slide without the faintest risk of
injury. The superfluous spirit is now to be drained
off, and just as the section is becoming glazed and
sodden-looking (<i>not dry</i>) we must, by means of the
long glass stopper (§ 21), apply to it a large drop of
clove oil. The oil, however, should not be placed on
the section, but be allowed to drop on to the slide near
to its margin. By gently tilting the slide the oil will
gradually insinuate itself <i>beneath</i> the section and slowly
ascend through it to the surface. The slide should
now be covered with a bell-glass (or wine-glass), and
about two minutes allowed for the oil thoroughly
to saturate the section. As much as possible of the
superfluous oil must then be drained off, and the remainder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>removed with blotting paper. By means of
the glass rod a small quantity of chloroform-balsam
is now taken from the spirit lamp which contains it,
and allowed gently to fall upon the section, which
must then be covered with a thin glass circle in the
manner previously described (§ 16). When the object
is very fragile, it is a good plan, after draining off the
clove oil, to apply the cover directly upon the section,
and then to place a drop of the balsam near to the edge
of the cover. This, by capillary attraction, will speedily
diffuse itself beneath the cover, flowing over and surrounding
the object, without in the slightest degree
disturbing its position. If, during the process of
mounting, any air-bubbles arise, we may view their development
with equanimity, being well assured that as
the chloroform evaporates they too will quickly disappear.
When the mounting is completed, the slide
should be roughly labelled and placed on a warm mantel-piece
for a few days to dry.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p1-24'></a>24. <i>Finishing the Slide.</i>—In the course of two or
three days it will be advisable to take an old penknife,
and after heating the blade in the flame of a spirit lamp,
gently to run the point of it round the margin of the
cover, so as to remove any excess of balsam which may
have oozed from beneath it. In a few days more, any
remaining balsam may be carefully scraped away with
a cold knife. All remaining traces of balsam are then
to be removed from around the cover by means of a
rag <i>just moistened</i> with methylated spirit, or, what
is better, with a mixture of equal parts of spirit and
æther, after which the slide is to be thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>washed in cold water. The slide is now in reality
finished, but, in order to give it a smart appearance, it
is usual, with the assistance of the turn-table, to run a
ring of colored varnish round the covering glass. A
very useful varnish for the purpose is the <i>white zinc
cement</i>. To prepare this, dissolve an ounce of gum
dammar in an ounce of turpentine by the aid of heat.
Take one dram of oxide of zinc and an equal quantity of
turpentine; rub them up together in a mortar, adding
the turpentine drop by drop, so as to form a creamy
mixture perfectly free from lumps or grit. One fluid
ounce of the dammar solution previously made must now
gradually be added, the mixture being kept constantly
stirred (<i>Frey</i>). The cement, when made, should be
strained through a piece of fine muslin, previously
wetted with turpentine, into a small wide-necked bottle,
which, instead of having a cork or stopper, should be
covered with a loose metal cap. Instead of a bottle,
the varnish may be kept in one of the collapsible tubes
used by artists; but though this plan is highly recommended
by many, it is not without its disadvantages. If
the varnish becomes thick by keeping, a few drops of
turpentine or benzole well stirred in will soon reduce
it to a suitable consistence for use.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><a id='p2-25'></a>25. <i>Special Methods.</i>—Having in the preceding
pages entered at some length into the general subject
of section-cutting, it remains for us now to consider
those special methods of preparation which the peculiarities
of certain objects demand. In order to keep
the bulk (and consequent price) of this manualette
within due bounds, we shall, without further preface,
proceed to the description of these methods, in doing
which every endeavour will be made to employ such
brevity of expression as may be consistent with perfect
clearness of meaning. As the most convenient plan,
the objects here treated of will be arranged in alphabetical
succession.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-26'></a>26. <i>Bone.</i>—Both transverse and longitudinal sections
should be prepared, the former being the prettier
and most interesting. After prolonged maceration in
water, all fat, etc., must be removed and the bone
dried, when as thin a slice as possible is to be cut off in
the desired direction, by means of a very fine saw. If
the section so obtained be placed upon a piece of smooth
cork it may, with the aid of a fine file and the exercise
of care, be further reduced in thickness. It is then to
be laid upon a hone moistened with water, and being
pressed gently and <i>evenly</i> down upon it with the tip of
the finger (protected, if necessary, by a bit of cork or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>gutta-percha), it must be rubbed upon the stone until
the desired degree of thinness has been attained.
Finally, in order to remove scratches and to polish the
section, it should be rubbed upon a dry hone of very
fine texture, or upon a strop charged with putty-powder.
After careful washing in several waters the
section must be allowed thoroughly to dry, when it
may be mounted by the <i>dry method</i> in the following
manner:—A ring of gold-size must, by means of the
turn-table, be drawn in the centre of a slide, and the
slide put away in a warm place for several days (the
longer the better), in order that the ring may become
perfectly dry and hard. When this has been accomplished
the section is to be placed in the centre of the
ring, and a covering circle of the requisite size having
been cleaned, this must have a <i>thin</i> ring of gold-size
applied round its margin. The cover is now to be
placed in position and gently pressed down, a spring
clip being employed, if necessary, to prevent it from
moving. In about twenty-four hours another layer of
the varnish should be applied, and the slide afterwards
finished in the manner already described (§ 24). The
above method is also applicable to the preparation of
sections of <i>teeth</i> and also of <i>fruit-stones</i> and other hard
bodies, which are incapable of being rendered soft
enough for cutting.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the process just described, however, is both troublesome
and tedious, it is much better for ordinary purposes
to have recourse to the <i>decalcifying method</i>, by
which means sections in every way suitable for the
examination of the essential structure of bone may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>obtained with ease. To carry out this plan a piece of
fresh bone should be cut into small pieces and placed
in a solution made by dissolving 15 grains of pure
chromic acid in 7 ounces of distilled water, to which
30 minims of nitric acid s. g. 1.420 are afterwards to
be added. Here they should remain for three or four
weeks, or until the bone has become sufficiently soft to
cut easily, the fluid being repeatedly changed during
the process. From this solution they must be transferred
to methylated spirit for a few days, when a piece
may be selected, imbedded in paraffine, and cut in the
microtome (§ 12). Some of the sections should be
mounted, unstained, in spirit. For this purpose a cell
of gold-size, as above described, must first be prepared
and filled <i>full</i> of a mixture of spirit of wine one part,
and distilled water three parts. Into this the section
must be carefully placed and the cover applied, the
same precautions for the exclusion of air-bubbles being
taken which were recommended when speaking of
mounting in glycerine (§ 16). When the cover is in
position a ring of gold-size must be laid on, repeated
when dry, and the slide afterwards finished in the
ordinary manner. It will also be advisable to stain
some of the sections with carmine (§ 14), or picro-carmine
(§ 42), and mount them in glycerine. <i>Teeth</i>
may also be treated by the decalcifying method, but in
this case it must be remembered that the enamel will
dissolve away.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-27'></a>27. <i>Brain.</i>—The best hardening fluid is that recommended
by Rutherford, and is made by dissolving
15 grains of pure chromic acid and 31 grains of crystalized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>bichromate of potash in 43 ounces of distilled
water. Small pieces of brain, which have previously
been immersed for twenty-four hours in rectified spirit,
should be placed in about a pint of this solution, where
they must remain for five or six weeks, the fluid being
repeatedly changed during the process. If by this
time they are not sufficiently hard the induration must
be completed in alcohol. Sections are easily cut in the
microtome by the paraffine method (§ 12). These may
advantageously be stained in a solution of aniline blue,
made by dissolving 1-1/2 grain of aniline blue in 10
ounces of distilled water, and adding 1 drachm of rectified
spirit (<i>Frey</i>). As this stain acts very rapidly
two or three minutes’ immersion will generally be
found long enough. The sections must then be
mounted in balsam (§ 23).</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-28'></a>28. <i>Cartilage.</i>—The method to be employed in the
preparation of cartilage will entirely depend upon the
nature of the staining agent, to the action of which the
sections are to be submitted. Thus, if the elegant <i>gold
method</i> is to be followed, it is necessary that the cartilage
should be perfectly fresh; whilst if any of the
other staining agents are to be employed the tissue may
have been previously preserved in alcohol. An excellent
object on which to demonstrate the gold process
is to be found in the articular cartilage of bone. It is
a very easy matter to obtain from the butchers the foot
of a sheep which has just been killed. The joint is to
be opened, and the bones dissociated, when they will
be seen to have their extremities coated with a white
glistening membrane—this is the <i>articular cartilage</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Exceedingly thin slices must be at once cut from it,
and as only small sections are required, a sharp razor
may be used for the purpose, the blade being either
dry or simply wetted with distilled water. The sections
as cut are to be transferred to a small quantity of
a half per cent. solution of chloride of gold in a watch
glass. Chloride of gold may be purchased in small
glass tubes hermetically sealed, each tube containing 15
grains, and costing about 2s. If, however, the student
requires only a small quantity of the staining fluid he
need not be even at this small expense, for as photographers
for the requirements of their art always keep
on hand a standard solution of chloride of gold of the
strength of one per cent., a little of this may readily be
obtained, and diluted to the required degree. After
the sections have been exposed to the action of the
staining fluid for about ten minutes they may be transferred
to a small beaker of distilled water, and exposed
to diffused light for about twenty-four hours, when
they must be mounted in glycerine (§ 16).</p>

<p class='c012'>Sections of cartilage may also be examined, without
being stained, in which case the field of the microscope
should be only very feebly illuminated. Or carmine
staining (§ 14) may be resorted to—these sections show
well in glycerine, or if the staining be made very deep,
even Canada balsam may be employed, and with fair
results.</p>

<p class='c012'>Microscopists are indebted to Dr. Frances Elizabeth
Hoggan for the description of a new method of staining,
which we have found especially suited to the
treatment of cartilage. The agent employed is <i>iron</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and the process, which is very simple, is as follows.
Two fluids are necessary—(1) tincture of steel; (2) a
two per cent. solution of pyrogallic acid in alcohol. A
little of the former is to be poured into a watch glass,
and into this the sections, after having been previously
steeped in alcohol for a few minutes, are to be placed.
In about two minutes the iron solution is to be poured
away and replaced by solution No. 2. In the course
of a minute or two the desired depth of colour will have
been produced, when the sections are to be removed,
washed in distilled water, and mounted in glycerine.
The results obtained by this process are very beautiful,
the colour produced being a very fine neutral tint, of
delightful softness. The process also answers admirably
in the case of morbid tissues, and we have now in
our possession some sections of ulcerated cartilage
tinged by the iron method, in which the minute
changes resulting from the ulcerative disintegration are
brought out with wonderful distinctness.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the structure of cartilage differs according to its
purpose and situation, the student will find his time
profitably employed in a careful examination of the following
forms (α) <i>hyaline</i>—articular and costal; (β) yellow
fibro-cartilage—epiglottis, or external ear; (γ)
<i>cellular</i>—ear of mouse. Sections of the <i>intervertebral</i>
ligaments should also be made, in which the different
kinds of cartilage may be examined side by side with
each other.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-29'></a>29. <i>Coffee Berry</i> affords sections of great beauty.
The <i>unroasted</i> berry should be soaked for hours or days
in cold water until sufficiently soft; then imbedded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>paraffine, and cut in the microtome (§ 12), the section
being made in the direction of the long axis of the
berry. Put up in glycerine, or stain rather strongly
with carmine, and mount in balsam. The same
method of treatment may also be applied to other hard
berries or <i>seeds</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-30'></a>30. <i>Fat.</i>—Adipose tissue may be hardened in alcohol,
cut in paraffine, and mounted in glycerine.
If the tissue has been injected the sections may be
mounted in balsam, and are then very beautiful objects,
showing the capillary network encircling the fat
cells.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-31'></a>31. <i>Hair.</i>—Longitudinal sections are readily made
by splitting the hair with a sharp razor. It is more
difficult to cut the hair transversely. This, however,
may easily be done in the following manner. The
hairs having previously been well soaked in æther to
remove all fatty matters, a sufficient number of them
must be selected to form a bundle about the thickness
of a crow quill. This bundle, after being tied at each
extremity with a bit of thread, is to be immersed for
several hours in strong gum (§ 18,) to which a few drops
of glycerine have been added. On removal, the bundle
must be suspended by means of a thread attached
to one end of it, in a warm place until sufficiently hard,
when it is to be imbedded and cut in paraffine (§ 12).
Each section, as cut, is to be floated off the knife into
methylated spirit. From this it is with the aid of the
spoon (§ 14) to be transferred to a slide, the spirit tilted
off, a drop of absolute alcohol added, when, after a
minute or two, this also is to be drained off, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>section treated with clove oil, and the mounting completed
as described in § 23.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-32'></a>32. <i>Horn</i> varies very much in consistence, in some
instances having a cartilaginous character, whilst in
others it is almost bony. In the latter case, sections
will have to be ground down in the manner explained
when speaking of bone (§ 26). Where the texture is
less dense, recourse may be had to prolonged steeping
in hot or boiling water; in some cases it will be necessary
to continue the immersion for several hours. When
sufficiently soft the piece of horn may, by means of bits
of soft wood, be firmly wedged into the tube of the
microtome, and sections cut with a razor, or what is
better, with a broad and very sharp chisel. The sections
are to be put between glass slips, held together
by American clips (or pegs), and put away for two or
three days in order to become thoroughly dry. After
well soaking in good turpentine or benzole, they must be
transferred to slides, the superfluous turpentine drained
off, and chloroform-balsam added, etc. (§ 23). Sections
of horn should, of course, be cut in different
directions, but for examination with the polariscope
those cut transversely yield by far the most magnificent
results. <i>Hoofs</i>, <i>whalebone</i>, and allied structures
should also be treated by the above method.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-33'></a>33. <i>Intestine.</i>—The method to be pursued with <i>sections</i>
has already been described (§ 18). The ileum,
however, is a very pretty object when a portion of it is
so mounted as to show the <i>villi erect</i>. To do this it is
necessary to cement to the slide, by marine glue, a glass
cell of sufficient depth. This should have been prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>some time beforehand, so that the cement may
be perfectly dry and hard. The cell is now to be filled
with turpentine, and the piece of ileum (having been
previously passed through methylated spirit and absolute
alcohol into turpentine) is gently placed into it,
having the villi uppermost; pour some pure and rather
fluid balsam on the object at one end, and gradually
incline the slide, so as to allow the turpentine to flow
out at the opposite side of the cell, till it is full of balsam.
Then take a clean cover, and having placed upon
it a small streak of balsam from one end to the other,
allow it gradually to fall upon the cell, so as to avoid
the formation of air-bubbles (§ 17), and finish the slide
in the usual manner.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Or, the intestine may be dried,
and mounted <i>dry</i>, in a cell with a blackened bottom,
for examination as an opaque object.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-34'></a>34. <i>Liver.</i>—Small pieces of liver may be very successfully
hardened by immersion in alcohol, beginning
with weak spirit and ending with absolute alcohol. Cut
and mount as usual.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-35'></a>35. <i>Lung</i> must be prepared in chromic acid (§ 5).
For the cutting of sections the freezing microtome
(§ 18) is of especial value, and should, therefore, be
used. If, however, the student be not provided with
this instrument, he must proceed as follows. A small
piece of lung, previously deprived of all spirit, is to be
immersed until thoroughly saturated in solution of gum
(§ 18). A small mould of bibulous paper (§ 2), only
just large enough to receive the piece of tissue, having
been prepared and filled with the mucilage, the specimen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>is to be transferred to it. The mould, with its
contents, is now to be placed in a saucer, into which a
mixture of about 6 parts of methylated spirit and 1 part
of water (<i>Schäfer</i>) is to be poured until the fluid reaches
to within about a third of the top of the paper mould.
In the course of several hours the surface of the mucilage
will begin to whiten and solidify. As soon as this
occurs more dilute spirit must be poured into the saucer,
until the mould is completely submerged. In a day or
two the gum will be found to have acquired a suitable
consistence for cutting, when it must be removed from
the spirit, the paper mould peeled off, and the mass
imbedded and cut in paraffine, the sections being afterwards
treated as if they had been obtained by the freezing
method (§ 18). If the solidification of the gum
should proceed too slowly, a few drops of pure spirit
may be added to the contents of the saucer. If, on
the other hand, the gum should become overhard, it
will be necessary to put into the saucer a few drops of
water, and repeat this until the required consistence be
obtained.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-36'></a>36. <i>Muscle.</i>—Harden in chromic acid, and cut in
paraffine. Transverse sections may be made to show the
shape of the fibrils. Longitudinal sections will only
be required in the case of injected tissues, when such
sections will be found very elegant, showing, as they
do, the elongated meshes of capillaries running between
and around the muscular fasciculi. Mount in glycerine
or balsam. To see the transverse striæ characteristic
of voluntary muscle, a very good plan is to take a bit of
pork (cooked or fresh), and by means of needles to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>teaze it out into the finest possible shreds. If these be
examined in water or glycerine, the markings will be
shown very perfectly.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-37'></a>37. <i>Orange-peel</i>, common object though it be, is not
to be despised by the microscopist. Transverse sections
must be prepared by the gum method (§ 35).
These sections are not to be subjected to the action of
alcohol (as this would destroy the colour), but after
<i>drying</i> between glass slides they must be soaked in
turpentine and mounted in balsam. We shall then
have a good view of the large globular glands whose
office it is to secrete that essential oil upon which the
odor of the orange depends.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-38'></a>38. <i>Ovary</i> may be prepared in the same manner as
liver (§ 34). Sections, which are to be cut in paraffine,
may be stained with carmine, and mounted in glycerine
or balsam. Apart from all scientific value, we know
of no slide for the microscope which, even as a mere
object of show, surpasses in beauty a well-prepared section
of <i>injected</i> ovary, showing the wondrous Graafian
vesicles, surrounded by their meandering capillaries.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-39'></a>39. <i>Porcupine Quill.</i>—Soften in hot water, cut in
paraffine, and mount in balsam. Much (in our opinion
<i>too</i> much) lauded as an object for the polariscope.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-40'></a>40. <i>Potato.</i>—From the large amount of water which
it contains thin sections cannot be cut from the potato
in its natural state. It must, therefore, be partially
desiccated, either by immersion in methylated spirit for
a few days or by exposure to the air. Sections may
then readily be obtained by imbedding and cutting in
paraffine. Such sections mounted in balsam are very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>beautiful, the starch being seen <i>in sitú</i>, whilst if polarized
light be employed each granule gives out its characteristic
black cross.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-41'></a>41. <i>Rush</i> is to be prepared and cut as orange-peel
(§ 37). Transverse sections of this “weed” furnish
slides of the most exquisite beauty.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-42'></a>42. <i>Skin.</i>—To prepare skin for section a piece is to
be selected which, after having been boiled for a few
seconds in vinegar, must be stretched out on a bit of
flat wood, and being maintained in position by pins be
allowed to remain until thoroughly dry. Then imbed
in paraffine, and cut <i>exceedingly</i> thin transverse sections.
These may be stained in carmine, but more
beautiful results are obtained if picro-carmine be employed.
Sections of skin, when stained by this agent
are much increased both in beauty and instructiveness;
for the several constituents of the tissue becoming
tinged with different colours are readily distinguishable
from each other, whilst the contrast of colouring forms a
pleasing picture to the eye. The method of preparing
picro-carmine is very simple, though it sometimes yields
a solution not altogether satisfactory. The best formula
with which we are acquainted is that given by Rutherford,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
and if due care be taken in following it out failure
will generally be avoided. “Take 100 c.c. of a
saturated solution of picric acid. Prepare an ammoniacal
solution of carmine, by dissolving 1 gramme in a
few c.c. water, with the aid of excess of ammonia and
heat. Boil the picric acid solution on a sand bath, and
when boiling add the carmine solution. Evaporate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the mixture to dryness. Dissolve the residue in 100 c.c.
water, and filter. A clear solution ought to be obtained;
if not, add some more ammonia, evaporate, and dissolve
as before.” Sections may be exposed to the action
of this fluid for a period varying from fifteen to thirty
minutes, then rapidly washed in water, and mounted
in glycerine. They may also be mounted in balsam,
care being taken in that case to shorten as much as
possible the period of their immersion in alcohol, so that
no risk may be run of the picric acid stain being dissolved
out.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>If it is intended to study the structure of the skin
with anything like thoroughness, portions must of course
be examined from different localities, in order that
its several varieties and peculiarities may be observed.
Thus the <i>sudoriforous</i>, or sweat glands, may be found
in the sole of the foot, whilst the <i>sebaceous</i> glands are
to be sought in the skin of the nose. The <i>papillæ</i> are
well represented at the tips of the fingers,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> whilst the
structure of the shaft of the <i>hair</i>, together with that
of the follicle within which its root is enclosed, as also
the muscles by which it is moved, are to be studied in
sections of skin from the scalp or other suitable locality.</p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f17'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. <span class='small'>It is well, in connection with these papillæ, to bear in
mind a fact pointed out by <i>Frey</i>, namely, that the tips of the
fingers frequently become, <i>post-mortem</i>, the seat of extensive
natural injections; hence, in sections from this region, we frequently
obtain good views of distended capillaries without
having been at the trouble of previously injecting them.—<i>Frey</i>,
“Microscopical Technology.”</span></p>
</div>
<p class='c012'><a id='p2-43'></a>43. <i>Spinal Cord.</i>—The spinal cord, say of a cat
or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>a dog (or if procurable, of man), after being cut into
pieces about half an inch in length, may be hardened
in the usual chromic acid fluid (§ 5). As it is peculiarly
liable to overharden and become uselessly brittle,
the process must be carefully watched. Its further
treatment is the same as that of brain. These sections
may be stained very satisfactorily by the <i>ink process</i>,
for communicating details of which we are indebted
to the kindness of Dr. Paul, of Liverpool. The
agent usually employed is Stephenson’s blue-black ink,
which, for this purpose, must be quite fresh. As in
the case of carmine, two methods of staining may be
adopted—either rapid, by using concentrated solutions,
or more prolonged, according to degree of dilution.
For the reasons previously given (§ 14), slow methods
of staining are always to be preferred, as yielding the
most beautiful results, yet, for the purposes of preliminary
investigation, it is often convenient to have
recourse to the quick process. To carry out the latter
plan, an ink solution of the strength 1 in 5—10 parts
of water is to be freshly prepared, and the sections exposed
to its action for a few minutes. For gradual
staining the dilution must be carried to 1 in 30—50,
and the time of immersion prolonged to several hours,
the sections being occasionally examined during the
staining, so that they may be removed just as they
have acquired the desired tint. When a satisfactory
coloration has been obtained, the preparations should
be mounted in dammar or balsam (§ 23). One advantage
of this method of staining is, that definition is
almost as good by artificial light as by day.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><a id='p2-44'></a>44. <i>Sponge</i> may readily be cut after being tightly
compressed between two bits of cork; or its interstices
may be filled up by immersion either in melted paraffine
(§ 11) or in strong gum (§ 18), and then cut as
usual.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-45'></a>45. <i>Stomach</i> requires no special method of hardening
(chromic acid). Sections should always, when
practicable, be cut in the freezing microtome. In
default of this, proceed in the manner as directed for
lung (§ 35). Both vertical and horizontal sections will,
of course, be required. If the preparation has been
injected, the latter are particularly beautiful. Stain
with carmine or aniline blue (§ 27), and mount—if for
very close study, in glycerine—if injected and for a
“show” slide, use balsam.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-46'></a>46. <i>Tongue.</i>—Harden in chromic acid, imbed and
cut transverse sections in paraffine. As, however, the
paraffine is apt to get entangled amongst the <i>papillæ</i>,
whence it is afterwards with difficulty dislodged, it will
be as well before imbedding to soak the tongue in
strong gum for a <i>few minutes</i>, and afterwards immerse
in alcohol till the gum becomes hardened, so that the
delicate papillæ may thus be protected from the paraffine
by a surface-coating of gum. The best staining
agent is picro-carmine (§ 42). Sections of <i>cat’s</i> tongue
near the root, when thus stained, furnish splendid
objects. Sections should also be made of the <i>taste-bulbs</i>,
found on the tongues of rabbits. These are small oval
prominences, situated one on each side of the upper
surface of the tongue near its root. They should be
snipped off with scissors, and vertical sections made in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the direction of their long axis. Stain with carmine
or picro-carmine, and mount in glycerine or balsam.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-47'></a>47. <i>Vegetable Ivory</i>.—After prolonged soaking in
cold water may readily be cut in the microtome. The
sections should be mounted in balsam, and though not
usually regarded as polariscopic objects, nevertheless,
when examined with the <i>selenite</i>, yield very good
colours.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='p2-48'></a>48. <i>Wood.</i>—Shavings of extreme thinness may be
cut from large pieces or blocks of timber, by means of
a very sharp plane. In this way very good sections
may be procured of most of the common woods, as oak,
mahogany, “glandular wood” of pine, etc. Where
however, the material to be operated upon takes the
form of stems, roots, etc., of no great thickness, they
should, after having been reduced to a suitable consistence
(§ 4), be imbedded in paraffine, and cut in the
microtome. Before imbedding it must not be forgotten
to immerse the wood to be cut in weak gum-water
(§ 11), this precaution being of great importance,
especially in the case of stems, etc., the bark of which
is at all rough and sinuous. If the sections are to be
mounted <i>unstained</i>, they are usually put up in weak spirit
(§ 26). A very general method also of dealing with
this class of objects is to mount them <i>dry</i> (§ 26). This
plan, however, cannot be recommended, for however
thin the sections may be, the outlines, when this process
is adopted, always present a disagreeable black or
blurred appearance. To avoid this we may have recourse
to Canada balsam, but the ordinary method of
employing it must be slightly modified, a drop of chloroform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>being substituted for the clove oil (§ 23), otherwise
this latter agent will cause the section to become
so transparent as to render minute details of structure
difficult to recognize. A better plan, perhaps, is to
stain the section with carmine or logwood, and mount
in balsam by the ordinary process. The best course to
follow, however, especially in the case of transverse
sections, is the <i>double staining</i> method.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> For this
purpose the sections in the first place must be subjected
to the action of a solution of chloride of lime
(1/4 oz. to a pint of water) until they become thoroughly
bleached. They must then be soaked in a solution
of hyposulphite of soda (one drachm to four ounces of
water) for an hour, and after being washed for some
hours, in several changes of water, are to be transferred
for a short time to methylated spirit. Some
red staining fluid is now to be prepared by dissolving
half a grain of Magenta crystals in one ounce
of methylated spirit. A little of this solution being
poured into a small vessel of white porcelain (§ 14),
the sections are to be immersed in the dye for about
thirty minutes. They are now to be removed, and
after <i>rapid</i> rinsing in methylated spirit to remove
all superfluous colour, they must be placed in a blue
staining fluid made by dissolving half a grain of aniline
blue in one drachm of distilled water, adding ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>minims of dilute nitric acid and afterwards sufficient
methylated spirit to make two fluid ounces. The sections
must be permitted to remain in this solution for
a very short time only, one to three minutes being generally
sufficient, for as the action of the dye is very
energetic, it will, if too long exposure be allowed, completely
obliterate the previous coloration by the magenta.
After being again <i>rapidly</i> rinsed in methylated spirit, as
much of this as possible must be drained off, and the
sections put into oil of <i>cajeput</i>, whence, in an hour,
they may be transferred to spirits of turpentine, and
after a short soaking, mounted in balsam.</p>

“free-hand” method, and although it is not generally employed
for the production of cabinet specimens or slides that are intended
for sale, yet it possesses so many advantages that every
student should endeavor to acquire the art of cutting sections
without the use of the microtome. For purposes of study such
sections are quite equal to the best of those usually found on
sale, and for the encouragement of beginners we may add that
we have seen sections cut by the free-hand method which for
size, thinness and accuracy, excelled any that we have ever seen
produced with the microtome. Indeed Schäffer distinctly affirms
that no microtome can equal the skilled hand in the production
of thin sections.</span></p>

to raise the cutting edge too far above the surface of the plate. This
gives rise to great irregularities.</span></p>

    <div>KNIVES FOR CUTTING SECTIONS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'><span class='sc'>Success</span> in cutting sections depends more upon the excellence
of the knife that is used than upon any other one point,
and therefore the art of keeping the knife in good order is one
which should be acquired by every microscopist, even at the
cost of considerable time, study and labor. As a stepping stone
to the acquisition of this art, there are certain general principles
which must be thoroughly understood before we can hope for
success in practice. These principles are simple, and when once
clearly stated, quite obvious, but they are frequently overlooked.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Cutting instruments act in two ways—either as simple wedges or as a
series of wedges, the latter being generally known as the saw-like
action. It is frequently stated in school philosophies that the edges of
<i>all</i> cutting instruments are toothed like a saw, and that they act
like a saw; this is evidently not the case with many, such as the axe,
the chisel, the plane, etc., and it is not even true of several to which
it is frequently applied, such as the razor, the penknife, etc. The
action can be said to be “saw-like” only when the teeth act as
independent wedges and remove a small portion of the substance acted
upon, the portion being known as <i>saw-dust</i>. Now in cutting
sections of wood with a sharp razor, where but a single stroke is used
to carry the cutting edge across a section, say half an inch in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>diameter, the edge of the razor does not act like a saw; none
of the material is removed except the section itself; in other
words, there is no saw-dust. That the edge of the knife or
razor is not even, is very easily proved by means of the microscope,
but it will be found that the notches and projections form
a series of lancet-shaped knifelets, each one of which acts just
as does the blade of a penknife when drawn over a piece of
wood or a quire of paper. Now if we lay a quire of paper on a
board and draw the edge of a penknife over it, we will cut down
through the paper, not by sawing but by a moving wedge. It is
precisely in this way that the little lancet-shaped teeth on the
edge of a razor act when the latter is used to cut a section.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>If we further examine the edge of the razor, we will find
that the bottoms of the notches are comparatively blunt; if
therefore we press the razor directly forward we soon press
these blunt portions of the general edge against the material to
be cut, and the resistance becomes so great that the material is
actually crushed or torn. This would not happen if we had an
absolutely perfect edge—one without any notches. This being
practically unattainable, however, we must endeavor to make
up for it by a sawing motion, (though not a sawing action) at
the same time seeking to avoid as much as possible those saw-like
features which render this motion necessary. We have
dwelt at length upon this point because so much has been written
comparing the edge of a razor to that of a saw, that some
persons actually advise us to give the edges of our knives and
razors a saw-like character, under the impression that by so doing
they will work better. This is a fallacy; the best work will
be obtained from the smoothest and most perfect edge, provided
the latter is thin enough.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>If the material of which our cutting instruments are made
would allow it, that is to say if it was perfectly hard, perfectly
rigid and incapable of being crushed or torn apart, the proper
shape of a cutting instrument would be a wedge of the most
acute form possible. But since the steel which we use is limited
in its hardness and its power of resisting crushing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>bending influences, the blades of our knives must have a certain
strength or thickness, depending upon the character of the material
to be cut. For very hard substances the knife must be
stout and the edge ground to a comparatively obtuse angle;
for moderately soft substances, such as wood, the angle may be
more acute, while for very soft tissues the thinnest blade and
the sharpest edge are most suitable.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The various angles to which cutting tools of different kinds
are ground are shown in the accompanying illustrations, which
explain themselves.</span></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>In the diagrams just given, the sides of the wedge are
carried in straight lines to the very edge. In practice, however,
this is never done, there being two strong objections to
such a form. In the first place if the sides were as shown in
the figures, every time the tool was ground or set, the entire
side would have to be ground off, and this would involve great
labor. But another difficulty,
quite as great, would occur in
the use of the instrument, for
since the wedge keeps growing
constantly and proportionately
thicker, the friction between
the sides of the wedge and the
material would rapidly become
very great. Therefore most
cutting edges are ground to a
second angle, much more obtuse
than the first, and it is
this second angle which forms
the true cutting edge. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>is obvious that the mass of material required to carry out the
ultimate angle in any case is wholly unnecessary, for if the tool
be strong enough at <i>a b</i> (Fig. 2) it will certainly be strong
enough at <i>c d</i>. An extreme illustration of this principle is
shown in the cold chisel used for cutting iron, the edge of which
is shown in Fig. 2, and the angle of 80° to which it is ground
is carried out by dotted lines. The angle which the sides of
the chisel (not the sides of the extreme cutting edge however)
make with each other is 25°.</span></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 4.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>There are two methods by
which this change of angle
may be made, one of which is
shown in the cold chisel just
figured, and the other in the
razor of which a section is
shown in figures 3 and 4. In
the case of the cold chisel it
will be seen that the tool is
first formed to a thin straight
wedge which is afterwards
changed to one that is much
more blunt. This answers
very well where the ultimate
angle is comparatively large
or blunt, as is the case with
penknives, table-knives, carving-knives,
etc. But where the
ultimate angle is very small
this plan does not answer well,
and the method shown in Fig.
3 is generally adopted. Here the ultimate angle is such that lines
touching the extreme edge and the back of the blade are perfectly
straight and form the actual cutting angle. In this case,
therefore, the relief is obtained by hollowing out the sides of the
blade, and this is done to various extents, the extremes being
shown in figures 3 and 4. Fig. 3 shows a section of a razor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>ground on a stone 12 inches in diameter, which is as large as is
generally used for this purpose. Fig. 4 is a section of a razor
ground on a four-inch stone—the smallest in general use. This
method of changing the angle is of course substantially the
same as the first, merely differing in the mechanical device
used, but it affords this important advantage that in the subsequent
honing and stropping processes the back of the razor
forms a perfect guide by which the ultimate angle may be determined.
This is not the case with the cold chisel or the
carving-knife, in both of which cases the eye and hand alone
determine the cutting angle, which is therefore apt to become
irregular or even rounded—the
worst form of all. This will be
more easily understood from
the following engravings
where A, Fig. 5, shows a penknife
blade, as applied to an
oilstone for the purpose of giving
it the final edge. The angle
here shown is considerably
greater than that generally used, but the principle is the same.
It is evident that if, in moving the blade back and forth on the
stone we allow it to rock or change the angle which the blade
makes with the stone’s surface, the edge will become rounded
as shown in Fig. 6—a form which for delicate work is useless.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>If the blade be laid down flat as at B, Fig. 5,
the labor of wearing away the superfluous metal
will be enormous. But if the blade be hollow as
Fig. 7, (where the hollow is, for clearness of illustration,
slightly exaggerated) then the ultimate
angle may be formed quickly and accurately,
there being no danger of the angles being changed on account
of want of skill on the part of the operator.</span></p>

<p>Fig. 8.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>In some cases one side is left quite flat and the other side is
ground to two or sometimes three angles, as in the carpenter’s
chisel, a section of which is shown in Fig. 8, where <i>a a</i> shows the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>angle made by the body of the blade; <i>b b</i> the angle of the bevel
formed by the grindstone, and <i>c c</i> the angle of the cutting edge
which is formed by the oilstone. In this case the flat side
A B forms a straight guide and
enables the workman, in cutting,
to make straight, clean
work. In sharpening such a
tool on the oilstone the flat side
is always laid flat on the oilstone
and merely smoothed
off,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and the skill of the workman
is chiefly shown in the
accuracy with which he forms the angle <i>c</i> B <i>c</i>. The dexterity
with which skilled workmen can effect this by the hand alone
is astonishing, but in the hands of those who
have had but little practice the edge infallibly
becomes rounded as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore
wherever a knife with a flat side is used, no attempt
should ever be made to grind this flat side
on the hone. Such an attempt will almost always
result in an edge so irregular that it will be
almost impossible to cut a good section with it.
But if the under side of the knife be left truly
flat, we will have the very best tool that can be
had for use with the microtome. Unfortunately,
however, it is very difficult to get a knife with a
truly flat surface, that is, one that is perfectly
“out of wind” as mechanics say. As a general
rule the flat sides of knives are not true planes but
irregularly curved surfaces; consequently when
laid on a plane surface, such as the table of a microtome,
they rock, and the edge is in contact with the table at some
points and separated from it at others, and the points which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>are in contact change as the knife is moved diagonally across
the table. This makes the section irregular and worthless.
But a really good knife with a perfectly true flat side
is such a valuable tool that a good deal of effort may be profitably
expended in getting it, and when once obtained never let the flat
side be touched by a grindstone, or more than touched by a hone.
It is not absolutely necessary, however, that the sides of a delicate
knife should be curved, provided the knife is used for cutting
very soft materials. An angle of 10° or even 5° gives a
pretty stout blade when carried back three-quarters of an inch,
as may be seen by examining Fig. 1, and the guiding action of
the very thick back may be obtained by means of an artificial
guide, applied like the brass backs of tenon saws. Such an arrangement
is shown in Fig. 9, and has been found very effectual.</span></p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f19'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. <span class='small'>Holtzapffel tell us that chisels that are required for paring
across the end grain of moderately soft wood are considered to hang
better to the work when they have a very slight keen burr or wire edge
thrown up on the face or flat side of the tool. But this does not apply
to section knives.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>When the knife
is to be honed, the
back is applied and
fastened by means
of two or three set
screws. When laid
on the hone, the
edge of the knife
and the lower surface of the back form the guide and regulate
the cutting angle. In this way we can use a broad, thin blade
and yet secure great accuracy in honing it. Such a blade has
this advantage also, that it is not so liable to be rounded and
thus injured by stropping as one in which the relief is obtained
by hollowing out the sides.</span></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 9.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Such, then, are the general principles which govern the construction
of cutting tools, including the section knives used by
microscopists. We will now give a few practical directions for
selecting a knife and putting and keeping it in order.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>In selecting a knife for cutting sections, regard must be had
to the texture of the material that is to be cut. To attempt to
cut delicate sections of soft tissues with the stout knives which
are suitable for cutting sections of woody fibre would be to destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the sections, while to reverse the operation and cut sections
of wood with thin, delicate knives would result in the
ruin of the knife. We have seen a most excellent knife seriously
injured by an attempt to cut material that was too hard
for it. The knife was very thin, and had proved most excellent
in cutting sections of such material as kidney, liver, etc. An
attempt was made, against our protest, to cut a section of an
apple-shoot, the wood of which was mature. Before the knife
had gone half way across, it bent, dug into the wood and
broke, leaving an ugly gap in the middle. Experienced section-cutters
know this very well, but young microscopists are not so
familiar with the facts just stated, and the point is too important
to be overlooked. Those, therefore, who devote themselves
to microscopical studies, or who expect to make sections
of materials of several kinds, differing in hardness, etc.,
must provide themselves with knives of different degrees of
strength.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>For common work, good razors are as good as anything,
provided they can be obtained with straight edges. Where
razors are not suitable, recourse must be had to the surgical
instrument maker, though we are sorry to say that there are
but few in this country that know how to forge, temper and
grind a decent knife. Most of our dealers in instruments do
not make the instruments they sell; they import the goods they
sell with their names stamped on, and thus get a reputation as
manufacturers; a special order they are unable to fill respectably.
There are some exceptions, but of the majority of dealers
what we have written above is true.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The points which specially demand attention in a knife for
cutting sections are these: 1. Quality of the steel used; 2. Temper;
3. Form of the blade.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Of the quality of the material of which a knife is made,
nothing can be determined except by actual trial. The old
tests of staining with acids, examining with the microscope,
etc., are worthless, or at least too crude and uncertain to be of
any practical value. Color changes with the degree of polish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>that is produced, and, in short, there is no reliable guide. The
purchaser must depend entirely upon the reputation of the
manufacturer. There is plenty of good steel to be found; the
trouble lies with the cutlers. They are careless and in haste,
and as a consequence they burn the steel or fail to work it sufficiently,
and the result is a useless tool.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The steel may be of the very best quality, however, and well
forged, and yet the knife may fail from being badly tempered—too
soft or too hard. If too soft, the edge is soon dulled; the
knife requires to be frequently honed, and the time wasted in
keeping it in order is a serious drawback. If too hard, it is
impossible to give it a keen edge, for the metal crumbles away
as soon as it is honed or stropped very thin, and the edge becomes
ragged and dull. Good steel, well forged, may be so
tempered that it will neither crumble nor become rapidly dull.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Much may be learned on this point from careful inspection
of the edge, and trial on a piece of horn, such as an old razor
handle. When drawn over a clean piece of horn once or twice
the edge of a soft knife is completely dulled; if well-tempered
it should scarcely lose its keenness. Again, when laid flat on
the thumb nail and pressed, the edge ought to bend up without
breaking or crumbling, and at once, when the pressure is removed,
resume its original shape. The extent to which extreme
hardness and durability, or toughness, may be combined,
is well shown in the famous Toledo sword-blades. One of these
blades will shear through an iron nail without having its edge
perceptibly dulled, and yet so tough and springy is it that it
may be coiled up into a hoop of several folds without breaking
or receiving any permanent set. If we could only get section
knives of stuff like this, it would be a pleasure to work with
them.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>After all, however, the only test of these two points, material
and temper, is a fair trial in actual practice. Of the form
of the blade, however, it is easy to judge, and there are a few
points which are frequently overlooked and which give rise to
errors that are attributed to other causes.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><span class='small'>In the text we are told that “It is essentially necessary that
the back and edge of the blade be strictly parallel to each
other.” The author undoubtedly knew what the correct form
should be, but the definition he has given is not a correct mathematical
statement of the conditions involved. These are as
follows:</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'><i>The edge must form a straight line, and both the edge and the
under side of the back must lie in the same plane.</i></span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Let us consider these conditions somewhat carefully.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Since the hole in which the material to be cut is imbedded, is always
circular, and since the blade is generally pressed forcibly against the
table of the microtome, it is obvious that if the edge of the knife be
curved it will sink into the hole to a greater or less depth according
as it is further from the centre of the hole or nearer to it. To explain
this let us refer to the greatly exaggerated drawing given in figure 10
where the edge of the knife, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, is shown in two
different positions covering the hole of the microtome. The least degree
of reflection will show that as the knife passes towards the centre from
<i>a b</i> to <i>aʹ bʹ</i>, it will have a tendency to turn on the back
as on a hinge, and the middle of the edge will sink deeper into the hole
as it approaches the centre of the latter. The section will therefore
vary in thickness and prove useless. This difficulty can be obviated
only by the use of a straight edge like <i>e f</i>, which will always
lie in the same plane.</span></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_086.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 10.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>If the knife were perfectly rigid, and the curved edge and
back lay entirely in the same plane, this difficulty would not
occur to any great extent. But since a curved edge rarely lies
wholly in the plane of the back of the knife, and since the
blades of most knives, especially those thin ones used for cutting
sections of soft tissues, yield a little to pressure, and since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>this pressure is never exactly the same, it is impossible to prevent
irregularities from occurring.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>While it is not necessary that the back of the knife and the
cutting edge should be parallel to each other, it is absolutely
necessary that they be in the same plane, or, as mechanics say,—“out
of wind.” If this condition be not observed, the blade
will rock on the microtome table as it passes over it, and irregularity
in thickness of section will result.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>A slight knowledge of geometry will enable any one to see
that these statements are strictly accurate.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>As regards other points in the form of the knife, we refer
to what has been previously said when discussing the general
principles which should govern the construction of cutting
tools.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>We now proceed to give a few practical directions for sharpening
knives and razors and keeping them in order.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Section knives, during the process of sharpening, are subjected
to three distinct processes: 1, Grinding; 2, Honing;
3, Stropping.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Grinding is one of the most important, though it is probable
that it will rarely be undertaken by the microscopist himself.
More knives and razors are spoiled in grinding than in
any other way. We have now in our possession an excellent
knife, which in an evil hour we entrusted to a New York cutler,
and received it back utterly ruined, the temper being entirely
taken out of the blades! Some of our readers may wonder at
this, but unfortunately it is too true. The cutler, to save time
and trouble, too frequently holds the blade against the stone
with such force that it becomes over-heated, especially when he
is a little careless and allows the supply of water to fall short.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
The owner does not find this out until he discovers that the
knife is ruined, because nothing is more easy than to cool the
blade and grind off the tell-tale blue spots. When charged
with his rascality, the cutler always denies it and lays the blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>on a “soft spot in the steel”—a miserable subterfuge—too transparent
to deceive the least experienced.</span></p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f20'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. <span class='small'>Nothing is more easy than to heat a thin rod or stout wire red hot by
holding it against a dry grindstone rapidly revolving. We have often
kindled fire in this way.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The only protection against this is either to entrust the knife
to a man of known carefulness and integrity, or to stand over
him while he does it. If the knife be ground under the owner’s
eye, no fear need be entertained, because it is easy to insist upon
the use of plenty of water.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The grindstone used for section knives should be of fine
grain, and it should run true and be very straight across the face,
otherwise it will be impossible to grind the knife true, and this,
as we have seen, is a necessity.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Every microscopist that expects to do much at cutting sections
must learn to hone his own knife or razor. Of the various
hones in use the famous Turkey oilstone is said to be altogether
the best. It is, however, very difficult to get it genuine
and in sufficiently large pieces. We therefore use the German
hone-slate, a softer, yellow stone of wonderful fineness and cutting
power. The ordinary whetstones are altogether too coarse,
and as for artificial stones and strops, they may do for coarse
work and common razors for <i>scraping</i>, but they will not do for
knives used for section-cutting. If any of our readers should
be so fortunate as to possess a good, old-fashioned Turkey oilstone
with a fair sized surface, let them think much of it. It
is invaluable. Years ago, when working on some investigations
that required the use of very sharp knives, we were offered, by
an old English carpenter, the use of a real Turkey stone. We
have never since found anything that did its work so quickly
and so well.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>To merely mention the substitutes for Turkey oilstone
would fill some pages. We therefore confine ourselves to the
German hone. It is obtained from the slate mountains in the
neighborhood of Ratisbon, where it occurs in the form of a
yellow vein running vertically into the blue slate, sometimes
not more than an inch in thickness, and varying to twelve to
eighteen inches. After being quarried it is sawed into thin
slabs, which are usually cemented to a similar slab of the blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>slate as a support, and the combined stones are then set in a
wooden frame and fitted with a cover, also of wood. Unlike
the Turkey oilstone, the Arkansas stone, and some others, the
German hone is soft and easily scratched and worn. It must
therefore be carefully preserved, and as the <i>flatness</i> of the hone
is an important point, it should never be used for anything but
section knives.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Having purchased a hone, the first thing to do is to see that
it is perfectly true; that is, that its surface is a perfect plane.
If hollow or twisted, it is useless until made straight. It may
be tested by means of two steel or wood straight-edges, and the
method of doing this, which is very simple but difficult to describe,
the microscopist can learn from any cabinet maker or
carpenter. If the hone be not true it must be made so, and this
is best done by grinding it with emery on a slab of marble or,
better still, a plate of cast iron which has been planed true.
(Waste castings with planed surfaces may be found in most
machine shops, and may be either borrowed or purchased for a
small sum.) If the hone is very uneven, coarse emery may be
used at first; then finer must be taken, and so on until the surface
of the hone is not only true but very smooth. This involves
considerable labor, but it cannot be avoided if a <i>true</i> edge as
well as a sharp one is desired, and hence our advice to use the
hone for nothing but section knives. Accuracy in a penknife
or a razor for shaving is of no consequence; in a section-knife
it is a <i>sine qua non</i>.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The surface of the hone must not only be true and smooth,
it must also be clean and free from dust and grit, a single particle
of which may spoil the work of hours. It should therefore,
when not in use, be kept constantly covered. It is always
used with oil, and this oil should be of a kind that does not
readily dry up. Good sperm is excellent, and so is purified
neat’s-foot oil. Avoid kerosene, soap and water, and similar
fluids, which are so frequently recommended, especially under
the guise of new discoveries. They have all been tried and
found wanting. After use, the stone should be carefully wiped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>clean, fresh oil being applied when it is next used. It must
never be used without a liberal supply of oil, otherwise it will
become glazed and will no longer act on the steel.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The hone being in good order, the blade is laid flat on it
and moved over its surface with circular sweeps. The method
of doing this is easily acquired, and is best learned by watching
an expert cutler at work. If we could only hit it, the perfection
of this operation would be to wear down the sides of the
blade until they just met; they would then form a keen and
perfect edge. Unfortunately we cannot always hit this point
exactly; we are apt to overdo the matter just a little, and then
comes up the <i>bête noir</i> of beginners—the “wire edge.” This
is caused by the metal of the blade bending away from the hone
as soon as it becomes of a certain degree of thinness. Once it
does this it cannot be worn off by the hone, and the only way to
remove it is to draw the edge of the knife or razor across a
piece of horn or hard wood. After removing the wire edge in
this way, give the blade one or two sweeps on the hone and
then strop it. If the blade be very soft, the wire edge comes
very quickly and easily, and is very hard to get rid of. On very
hard blades the wire edge is not so apt to make its appearance.
It comes, however, on very excellent blades. It may be avoided
in a measure by driving the blade edge-first over the hone, and
indeed the blade should always be sharpened most in this way.
And since the backward and forward strokes are always nearly
equal, as regards space passed over, this is accomplished by exerting
a greater pressure on the forward than on the backward
stroke.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>This wire edge is a nasty thing when it breaks off on the
hone. Unless removed it will very speedily ruin a fine knife,
therefore look out for it and wipe off the hone carefully if you
have any suspicion that particles of steel have broken off the
blade and got on to it.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>In honing, as in everything else, however, nothing but
practice will impart skill, and he who intends to become an
expert should practice on a few old razors, grinding, honing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and stropping them himself, until he has acquired the art of
giving them an edge far keener than most of the razors ordinarily
used for shaving.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The last operation to which the knife is subjected is that of
stropping, and as the blade should be stropped after every section,
it becomes important that our tools should be good and
that we should know how to use them. By having two or
three knives we can always avoid grinding and honing the
blades ourselves, for it is then easy to hire the work done, and
half a dozen knives will last a careful worker a long time with
merely the aid of a good strop. But the strop he must use
himself. Fortunately no great skill is required in stropping,
but the strop must be a good one and is best home-made.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Our readers have doubtless seen the “Cheap John” strop-vendors
take a rough table knife, strop it on one of their “patent”
strops and cut a hair with it. Nevertheless such a knife,
sharpened in that way, would not cut good sections, and such a
strop is not just the thing for giving the finishing touch to a
section-knife, even though the label does say that it is “intended
for surgical instruments.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></span></p>

<div class='footnote c014' id='f21'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. <span class='small'>The finest emery paper, glued on a strip of wood and used as a strop,
will impart to a razor an edge sufficiently keen to enable it to remove
the beard, and if paper three or four degrees coarser be used, a very
dull knife or razor may be sharpened, and afterwards stropped on the
finer emery until it is keen enough to cut a hair. But it will be found
that cutting edges produced in this way are not smooth enough for
section-cutting.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The strop should never be used with the intention of removing
metal so as to thin the edge of the knife. This is the
proper function of the hone, and those who depend most on the
hone and least on the strop, will always succeed best. The
strop is used in the first place for <i>smoothing</i> off the edge, and
in the second for removing that incipient dullness which always
comes from even the slightest use. It is true that in the
latter case the strop trespasses somewhat on the functions of
the hone, but only to a very slight extent, and stropping should
never be carried so far as to require more than a very few
strokes.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>The best material for a strop is good calf-skin, well tanned,
and firmly glued to a strip of wood with the hair side out. The
leather should be hard, otherwise it will rapidly round the edge
of the knife. The way in
which this occurs is readily
understood from figures 11
and 12. In Fig. 12 the leather
is seen to rise up behind
the edge of the blade as the latter passes over it, so that instead
of two plane facets meeting at an angle of from 15° to 20° as
left from the hone, (Fig. 12) the edge has become considerably
rounded and the ultimate angle
of the cutting edge is nearly
or quite doubled. The hardest
and firmest leather should
therefore be chosen, avoiding
of course any leather that has
been made hard and unpliable
by the action of water or other agents. Two sides will be found
enough for a strop. On one the leather should be kept clean,
while the other should be thoroughly impregnated with fine
grained, but very hard rouge or crocus.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Rouge is an artificial
oxide of iron prepared by exposing sulphate of iron to heat.
The hardness of the resulting powder depends upon the temperature
to which it has been exposed, and this temperature is
very well indicated by the color which the rouge assumes.
Bright red or crimson rouge is soft and will not cut steel; hard
rouge, suitable for polishing steel, is purple in color, and this
quality should therefore be chosen. Great care should be taken
to see that it is free from gritty particles, and it should be well
rubbed into the leather in a dry state. All mixtures of grease
and oil with abrasive substances should be eschewed. If the
leather be of good texture and the rouge hard and fine, a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>few strokes will suffice to impart the last degree of smoothness
and keenness to the blade.</span></p>
<div class='footnote c014' id='f22'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. <span class='small'>Rouge may be purchased from dealers in watch-makers’ tools. Those
who cannot procure it readily may very easily prepare it for themselves.
Full directions may be found in the “Amateur’s Handbook.” New York:
Industrial Publication Company.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>Since grit and dust would soon spoil the strop, it should be
kept carefully covered and protected. The rouge will require
occasional renewing, which may be done by sprinkling a little
lightly over the surface and rubbing it in with the finger.
Consequently we find that the best and most convenient holder
for rouge is a bottle with some fine but porous fabric tied over
the mouth of it, forming as it were a sort of dredge. Over the
bottle mouth and its cover should be tied a paper cap to keep
out dust.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>We have thus endeavored to give, in as simple a manner as
possible, such information as will guide the microscopist to the
acquisition of skill in this most important but generally despised
department of his art. We are told by the biographer
of Swammerdam that a great deal of his success was to be attributed
to his skill in sharpening his fine knives and scissors.
The same is also stated of other noted workers, and yet none
give even the slightest directions to the novice who desires to
follow in their footsteps. There is not to our knowledge a single
book in the English language which treats fully of this subject,
with perhaps the exception of Holtzapffel’s work on “Mechanical
Manipulation,” and this has long been out of print.
As previously stated, however, it is only by practice that the
necessary finger-skill can be acquired, but this skill is well
worth acquiring at any cost. The man who depends upon cutlers
and knife grinders will never make satisfactory progress.</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='small'>We are inclined to believe that the difficulty of enclosing
glycerine does not arise from the dissolving action of this liquid,
so much as from the great adhesiveness which exists between
it and glass. Oily cements are of course attacked by glycerine,
but shellac and several other gums are insoluble, and drying
oils, if well oxidized are also insoluble. Where cells are used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>they must be first firmly attached to the clean slide, and the
cement should also be brought into direct contact with the
clean cover. Glycerine does not evaporate at ordinary temperatures,
and consequently wherever the slide or cover is soiled
with it, no cement will ever adhere until the glycerine has been
wiped off. There is no prospect of its drying.</span></p>

    <div>The following are a few of the Opinions of the Press:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This is a small book, but full of matter. * * * We think this book is
full of interest and value; and as the discussions concerning the harmony
of science and faith are rife at the present day, we commend the reasonings
of Mr. Phin to the great number of readers and students who are
investigating these subjects.—<i>The Presbyterian</i> (Philadelphia).</p>

<p class='c019'>The author gives a new solution of this difficult question, and certainly
presents many very plausible arguments in support of his theory.—<i>Sunday-School
Workman.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>A very candid and ingenious essay.—<i>Christian Union</i> (H. W. Beecher’s
paper).</p>

<p class='c019'>No one can read this book without compensation, without becoming
more thoughtful concerning the phenomena of creation; and he need
lose none of his reverence for the supremacy of the Divine Law.—<i>Rural
New Yorker.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>We could say much in commendation of Prof. Phin’s little book. An
intelligent reader can hardly fail to be interested in it, and many might be
benefited.—<i>Country Gentleman.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>The book can not fail to interest even those who do not fully accept the
theory it advocates.—<i>Boston Journal of Chemistry.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>It is a new scientific view of the matter.—<i>Phrenological Journal.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>The book, although not large, will prove exceedingly interesting to all
who have ever directed attention to this matter, and contains more solid
and suggestive thought than many voluminous treatises on the subject.—<i>Insurance
Monitor.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>The work is ingenious and original, and presents many striking suggestions.—<i>American
Baptist.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>We believe Prof. Phin has started upon the correct basis, and his theory
is mainly tenable. His views are presented in a manner which, though
terse, is easily comprehended.—<i>Daily Guardian</i> (Paterson, N. J.)</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>It is characteristic of young Americans that they want to be <span class='fss'>DOING</span>
something. They are not content with merely <i>knowing</i> how things are done,
or even with <i>seeing</i> them done; they want to do them themselves. In other
words, they want to experiment. Hence the wonderful demand that has sprung up
for small tool chests, turning lathes, scroll saws, wood carving tools,
telegraphs, model steam engines, microscopes and all kinds of apparatus. In nine
cases out of ten, however, the young workman finds it difficult to learn how to
use his tools or apparatus after he has got them. It is true that we have a
large number of very excellent text-books, but these are not just the thing.
What is wanted is a living teacher. Where a living teacher cannot be found, the
next best thing is a live journal, and this we propose to furnish. And in
attempting this, it is not our intention to confine ourselves to mere practical
directions. In these days of knowledge and scientific culture, the “Why” becomes
as necessary as the “How.” The object of the <span class='sc'>Young Scientist</span> is to give
clear and easily followed directions for performing chemical, mechanical and
other operations, as well as simple and accurate explanations of the principles
involved in the various mechanical and chemical processes which we shall
undertake to describe.</p>

<p class='c019'>The scope and character of the journal will be better understood from an inspection
of a few numbers, or from the list of contents found on a subsequent
page, than from any labored description. There are, however, three features to
which we would call special attention:</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Correspondence.</span>—In this department we intend to place our readers in
communication with each other, and in this way we hope to secure for every one
just such aid as may be required for any special work on hand.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Exchanges.</span>—An exchange column, like that which has been such a marked
success in the <i>Journal of Microscopy</i>, will be opened in the Young Scientist.
Yearly subscribers who may wish to <i>exchange</i> tools, apparatus, books, or the
products of their skill, can state what they have to offer and what they want,

<p class='c019'>In a letter to the Editor, Oliver Wendell Holmes, the genial “Autocrat

latent ingenuity and thirst for knowledge which the youthful mind possesses,
and we hope it will win its way into every household in the land.”—[Scientific

<p class='c019'>“We have never seen a periodical, designed for youth, which came
nearer to our ideal of what such a journal should be.”—[Canadian
Pharmaceutical Journal.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The <span class='sc'>Young Scientist</span> is one of the choicest publications for juvenile
minds in this country. Every page treats on subjects of importance to
young and old, portrayed in a clearly comprehensive manner, which at
once interests the young idea in its careful perusal.”—[Lapeer Clarion.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It seems to fill the bill.”—[Newport Daily News.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is pleasing to note that its youthful subscribers will not be misled
by clap-trap advertisements or advertisements of patent medicines, which
will not be received at any price. The <span class='sc'>Young Scientist</span> is doing good
work in setting its face against this class of humbugs.”—[Manufacturing

<p class='c019'>“The work is a copiously illustrated monthly, and is full of practical

    <div>PROSPECTUS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The object of the <span class='sc'>Journal of Microscopy</span> is to diffuse a knowledge of the
best methods of using the Microscope; of all valuable improvements in the instrument
and its accessories; of all new methods of microscopical investigation,
and of the most recent results of microscopical research. The <span class='sc'>Journal</span> does
not address itself to those who have long pursued certain special lines of research,
and whose wants can be supplied only by elaborate papers, which, from
their thoroughness, are entitled to be called monographs rather than mere articles.
It is intended rather to meet the wants of those who use the microscope
for purposes of general study, medical work, class instruction, and even amusement,
and who desire, in addition to the information afforded by text-books,
such a knowledge of what others are doing as can be derived only from a periodical.
With this object in view, therefore, the publishers propose to make the
<span class='sc'>Journal</span> so simple, practical and trustworthy, that it will prove to the advantage
of every one who uses the microscope at all to take it.</p>

<p class='c019'>ILLUSTRATIONS.—The <span class='sc'>Journal</span> will be freely illustrated by engravings
representing either objects of natural history or apparatus connected with the
microscope.</p>

<p class='c019'>TRANSACTIONS OF SOCIETIES.—<span class='sc'>The American Journal of Microscopy</span>
is not the organ of any Society, but it gives the proceedings of all Societies
whose officers send us a report. As the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> is devoted <i>wholly</i> to Microscopy,
and is in good form and size for binding, no better medium can be had
for preserving the scientific records of any society. Matters of mere business
routine we are frequently obliged to omit for want of room.</p>

<p class='c019'>EXCHANGES.—An important feature of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> is the exchange column,
by means of which workers in different parts of the country are enabled, without
expense, except for postage, to exchange slides and materials with each other.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><b>TERMS.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>During the first two years of its existence, the subscription to the <span class='sc'>American
Journal of Microscopy</span> was only fifty cents per year, but at the request of
more than two-thirds of the subscribers, the size of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> has been
doubled, and the price raised to</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><b>ONE DOLLAR PER YEAR.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Four copies for three dollars. Those who wish to economize in the direction
of periodicals, would do well to examine our clubbing list.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Foreign Subscribers.</span>—The <span class='sc'>Journal</span> will be sent, postage paid, to any
country in the Postal Union for $1.24, or 5 shillings sterling per year. English
postage stamps, American currency or American postage stamps taken in payment.
In return for a postal order or draft for £1 5s., five copies of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span>
will be furnished and mailed to different addresses. Make all drafts and postal
orders payable to John Phin.</p>

<p class='c019'>BACK VOLUMES.—We have on hand a few copies of Vols. I and II, bound in
handsome cloth cases, which we offer for $1 25 each. Vols. I and II, bound, and
the numbers of Vol. III, as issued, we offer for $2.50. We can no longer supply
complete sets of 1876-7 in sheets. To those who wish to examine the journal, we
will send ten odd numbers for 25 cents.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><b>Advertisements.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The <span class='sc'>Journal of Microscopy</span>, from its very nature, is a visitor to the very
best families, and its value as an advertising medium has therefore proved to be
much above that of average periodicals. A few select advertisements will be
inserted at the rate of 30 cents per line, nonpariel measure, of which twelve

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
